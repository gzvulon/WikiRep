'''Rain''' is liquid  in the form of s that have  from   and then &#8212;that is, become heavy enough to fall under . Rain is a major component of the  and is responsible for depositing most of the  on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of , as well as water for  and crop .
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as . If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from  clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as  (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow . In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where  is maximized within  sides of the  at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the . The movement of the , or , brings  to  s.
The  effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities.  is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern  and drier conditions in the tropics. Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is , but over the whole Earth is it much higher at .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  classification systems such as the  system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. Rainfall is measured using s. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by .
Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of , ,  or even  rather than water.
Air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the ''mixing ratio'', is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as ; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a  (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The  is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling.  occurs when air rises and expands.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The air can rise due to , large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of , either by the air or by the surface underneath.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its , or until it reaches saturation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The main ways water vapor is added to the air are: wind convergence into areas of upward motion,&lt;ref name="convection"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; precipitation or virga falling from above,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; transpiration from plants,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; cool or dry air moving over warmer water,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and lifting air over mountains.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Water vapor normally begins to condense on  such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; force broad areas of upward motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as  or .&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of  during breezy conditions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets, or when water droplets freeze onto an ice crystal, which is known as the . Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Raindrops have sizes ranging from  mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like  buns; very large ones are shaped like s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over  and the  in 2004&#8212; some of them were as large as . The large size is explained by condensation on large  particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Rain drops associated with melting hail tend to be larger than other rain drops.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Raindrops impact at their , which is greater for larger drops due to their larger mass to drag ratio. At sea level and without wind,   impacts at  (), while large  drops impact at around  ().&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  hitting water is caused by bubbles of air oscillating underwater.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  code for rain is RA, while the coding for rain showers is SHRA.&lt;ref name="METAR"&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
Stratiform (a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in  (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of s and near and poleward of surface s. Similar ascent is seen around s outside of the , and in comma-head precipitation patterns around s.&lt;ref name="Geerts"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as s and , is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds  above ground level.&lt;ref name="mesoanal"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
, or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g.,  or . It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the  appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.&lt;ref name="Geerts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  and  indicate convection.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as s, s, and warm fronts.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Orographic precipitation occurs on the  side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in  cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the s), a more moist  usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the  or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see ) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a  is observed.&lt;ref name="MT"/&gt;

Windward sides face the east to northeast  and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In South America, the  mountain range blocks  moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.&lt;ref name="Andes"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  range creates the same effect in North America forming the  and s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The wet, or rainy, season is the time of year, covering one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''green season'' is also sometimes used as a  by tourist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the  and .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  climates and areas with  regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year.&lt;ref name="Hyde"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the  or  move poleward of their location during the middle of the warm season.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or , rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when  improves,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  quality improves,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vegetation grows significantly.
s, a source of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low pressure at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counter clockwise (northern hemisphere).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although s can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions.&lt;ref name="2005 EPac outlook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms , leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' , the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The urban heat island effect warms cities  to  above surrounding suburbs and rural areas. This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%. Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between  downwind of cities, compared with upwind.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities induce a total precipitation increase of 51%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30&#176;N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts&#8212;especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25percent).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a cyclone occludes, a '''tr'''ough '''o'''f '''w'''arm air '''al'''oft, or "trowal" for short, will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the -like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.&lt;ref name="TROW"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an  can yield significant amounts of rain.&lt;ref&gt;David R.

The pH of rain varies, especially due to its origin. On Americas East Coast, rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids,  (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and  (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raising the pH.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The K&#246;ppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the K&#246;ppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as , , , , , , , , , , , and desert.
Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A tropical savanna is a   located in  to semi- climate regions of  and  , with rainfall between  a year. They are widespread on , and are also found in , the northern parts of , , and .&lt;ref name="SAVWOOD"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The humid subtropical climate zone where winter rainfall is associated with large s that the  steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between s 20&#176; and 40&#176; degrees away from the equator.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
An oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern , and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year round.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the , parts of western , parts of  and , in southwestern  and in parts of central . The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A steppe is a dry .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Subarctic climates are cold with continuous  and little precipitation.&lt;ref name="subritter"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Rain is measured in units of length per unit time, typically in millimeters per hour, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or in countries where  are more common, inches per hour.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The "length", or more accurately, "depth" being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat, horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time, typically an hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99115.htm Rain gauge and cubic inches]&lt;/ref&gt; One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The inner cylinder is filled by  of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to  resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate  markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with. Any of the above rain gauges can be made at home, with enough know-how.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
When a precipitation measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet, such as  or GLOBE.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If a network is not available in the area where one lives, the nearest local weather or met office will likely be interested in the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the main uses of weather radar is to be able to assess the amount of precipitations fallen over large basins for  purposes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, river flood control, sewer management and dam construction are all areas where planners use rainfall accumulation data. Radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is,
:&lt;math&gt; Z = A R^b &lt;/math&gt;,
where Z represents the radar reflectivity, R represents the rainfall rate, and A and b are constants.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive  instruments aboard ing as well as  s to indirectly measure rainfall rates.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.
Rainfall intensity is classified according to the rate of precipitation:
* Light rain &#8212; when the precipitation rate is &lt;  per hour
* Moderate rain &#8212; when the precipitation rate is between  -  or  per hour&lt;ref name="rainint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UKint"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Heavy rain &#8212; when the precipitation rate is &gt;  per hour,&lt;ref name="rainint"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or between  and  per hour&lt;ref name="UKint"/&gt;
* Violent rain &#8212; when the precipitation rate is &gt;  per hour&lt;ref name="UKint"/&gt;
Euphemisms for a heavy or violent rain include gully washer, trash-mover and toad-strangler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gullywasher Gullywasher | Define Gullywasher at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toad-strangler toad-strangler - Wiktionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
The likelihood or probability of an event with a specified intensity and duration, is called the  or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of a storm can be predicted for any return period and storm duration, from charts based on historic data for the location.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''1 in 10year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is rare and is only likely to occur once every 10years, so it has a 10percent likelihood any given year. The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term ''1 in 100year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10year event. As with all probability events, it is possible, though improbable, to have multiple "1 in 100Year Storms" in a single year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.&lt;ref name="SERFC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts tend to be bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the mid to late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the , or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher  than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on . All s need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy s, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to .  can kill crops and increase erosion,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while overly wet weather can cause harmful  growth.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain  require small amounts of water,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.
In areas with wet and dry seasons,  nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.&lt;ref name="JS"/&gt; Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.&lt;ref&gt; (1993).
