'''Politics''' (from  ''politikos'' "of, for, or relating to citizens") is the  or  of influencing people on a civic, or individual level, when there are more than 2 people involved.
Modern political discourse focuses on democracy and the relationship between people and politics.  It is thought of as the way we "choose government officials and make decisions about public policy".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The word ''politics'' comes from the  word  (''politika''), modeled on 's "affairs of the city", the name of his book on governing and governments, which was rendered in English in the mid-15th century as Latinized "Polettiques".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it became "politics" in  c. 1520s (see the ). The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from  ''politique'', in turn from  ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which is the  of the Greek &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; (''politikos''), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state",&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from &#960;&#959;&#955;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962; (''polites''), "citizen"&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and that from &#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#962; (''''), "city".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of  stood at the forefront until the French Revolution put an end to the "".  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  to the 21st Century AD British Monarchy.  Kingship becomes an institution through heredity.
The king often, even in , ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a  without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors, and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power,  emerged, which may be considered the germ of . Long before the council became a bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by:
# Preserving the institution of kingship through heredity.
# Preserving the traditions of the social order.
# Being able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority.
# Being able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single individual such as the king.
The greatest of the king's subordinates, the , s and  in England and Scotland, the  and  in the Continent, always sat as a right on the Council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts . One of the functions of the Council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of  and the establishment of s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual. A right is a power enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really an institution brought around by public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual, the more it is appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State, man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came . With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the "lord of the land" of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same, then there is of course no evolution of property whatever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefitting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use the instrument of  for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of the , a place in which every man "does what he wills with his own." The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
As a primarily military institution, the State is concerned with the  of its subjects viewing disloyalty and  as well as other sorts of  as detrimental to its national security. Thus arises the law of . Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the whole, or at least part of  enforced by the State as distinguished from . State justice has taken the place of clan, feudal, merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity. One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that, until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings. The  was adopted by the Royal Courts, securing it's popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty. By the time of the , with the separation of Church and State, in the most progressive countries, the State succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The making of laws was unknown to primitive societies.
That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the , retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the  cities of the West. This tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society, it was  or  sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestors.
The state of affairs which existed in the 10th century, when every town had its own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century, was brought to an end  by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation:
# '''Records:''' From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people. Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless, the written text can change by addition with every new edition.
# '''Law Courts:''' By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to . At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the province of the jury.
# '''Fictions:''' Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect. Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open.
Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and development is rapid, the faster method of  is adopted. This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang  all over Europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted the rule of  and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the . Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come.
The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant . Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to . Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However, there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or  originated. The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by the State.
In the early days of political representation, the  did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested s but by the beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times: the . The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in government.
These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some purpose.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government.
Originally, the state was a military institution. For many years, it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain law and order the State develops means of . Historically, the "king's highway" was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to . In almost all countries, the State maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the  are rather limited. The State's original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to  administration which is a branch of the dispensation of  but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work. In the , the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the State was concerned with the raising of .  It was then useful to the State to establish a  of  so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a  of age. The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century, when  killed around half of the European population.
The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the policy until 's '''' was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the . The State, of course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village, the church and the s, it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that  was widespread in the rural areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the  of the , the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty, although the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism.
Taking into account the arguably significant powers of the State, it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid.
Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where "universal suffrage" prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action. Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good. Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than . Herein lies the basic difference between  and ; the first deals with the  while the second deals basically in  but both require a great deal of  and  to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only relating to  and  but also the State and the people administrating its .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Aristotle, States are classified into , , , , , and . Due to an increase in knowledge of the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the absolute best, as it would have to be the perfect form under all circumstances, for all people and in all ways. As an institution created by the human nature to , it is vulnerable to , no matter what form of government a state utillises, thus posing that there is no 'best' form of government.
All States are varieties of a single type, the sovereign State. All the  of the modern world rule on the principle of . Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an  or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government.  are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a Constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten Constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the Legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. Nevertheless, the written constitution is essential. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the  but after the  abandoned them to be taken up later by the  after their  and then  after the  and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.
There are two forms of government, one a strong central government as in France and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in England that is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the , first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1870 and in the 20th century, . The Federal States introduced the new principle of agreement or . Compared to a , a 's singular weakness is that it lacks . In the , the contention of the Confederate States that a State could  from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.
According to professor  in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''political party''' is a  that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within , usually by participating in , educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed  or vision bolstered by a written  with specific goals, forming a  among disparate interests.
The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the  but also the rise and fall of . The development of the  gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in . Later, the development of the  became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction. The  has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war. "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although an all-out final nuclear holocaust is out of the question for man, "" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October  from the implementation of  vs  nuclear blackmail policy.
, the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist  defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include , which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, , which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and , which examines the practices of governance. The philosopher , who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue," offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies," in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;
The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at , first occupied by Prussian &#233;migr&#233;  in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Several different s have been proposed.
Recently in history, political analysts and politicians divide politics into  and  politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by  or , for instance), and dates from the  era, when those members of the  who supported the , the common people and a  sat on the left and supporters of the ,  privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the  by  and  in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a  revolution to overthrow the  society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a  and  society.
The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values  and  while the left wing often values  and , with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with  or .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to , one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;, Norberto, "Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction" (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, . ISBN 0-226-06246-5&lt;/ref&gt;
Some ideologies, notably , claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', , 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include   economic politics in Italy,  in France,  in Argentina, and  in Mexico.
 and  refer to the amount of individual  each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual  and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the  and hold the  as . In their purest form, libertarians are , who argue for the total abolition of the state, of  and of , while the purest authoritarians are, theoretically,  who support state control over all aspects of .
For instance,  (also known as '' liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in much of the world, simply ''liberalism'') is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and . This includes the importance of human rationality, individual , s, , the protection of , constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of , , , , ,  and others. According to the libertarian , "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 
For anarchist political philosopher  "Liberalism and  are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual  yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;. ''''. BLACK ROSE BOOKS LID. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as  of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.
Forms of corruption vary, but include , , , , , , and . While corruption may facilitate  such as , , and , it is not restricted to these activities.  The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.
Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm African corruption 'on the wane'], 10 July 2007, &lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a , literally meaning "rule by thieves".

The word '''technology''' refers to the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of s, s, techniques, s, s, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include ''construction technology'', ''medical technology'', and ''information technology''.
The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The  discovery of  increased the available sources of food and the invention of the  helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the , the , and the , have lessened physical barriers to  and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of s of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from  to s.
Technology has affected  and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced  (including today's ) and has allowed the rise of a  . Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as , and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the  and its . Various implementations of technology influence the  of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of  in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.
Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the  or worsens it. , , and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as  and  view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other  and certain  communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.
The use of the term ''technology'' has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and usually referred to the description or study of the .&lt;ref name="Crabb"&gt;For ex., , [http://www.archive.org/stream/universaltechno01crabgoog#page/n525 ''Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences, Containing Definitions Drawn From the Original Writers''], (London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1823), s.v. "technology."&lt;/ref&gt; The term was often connected to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref name="Stratton"&gt;Julius Adams Stratton and Loretta H. Mannix, Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005), 190-92. ISBN
0262195240.&lt;/ref&gt; "Technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the . The meanings of technology changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with , translated ideas from the German concept of  into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'' that is absent in English, as both terms are usually translated as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not to the study of the industrial arts, but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref name="Schatzberg"&gt;Eric Schatzberg, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.3schatzberg.html "''Technik'' Comes to America: Changing Meanings of ''Technology'' Before 1930,"] ''Technology and Culture'' 47 (July 2006): 486-512.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."&lt;ref name="Bain"&gt;Read Bain, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2084365 "Technology and State Government,"] American Sociological Review 2 (December 1937): 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. But equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science, especially among scientists and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie"&gt;Donald A. MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman, "Introductory Essay" in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', 2nd ed. (Buckingham, England : Open University Press, 1999) ISBN 0-335-19913-5.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on  ("techniques de soi").
Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The  dictionary offers a definition of the term: "the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area" and "a capability given by the practical application of knowledge".&lt;ref name="mwdict"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to  or just , rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , in '''', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life", and as "organized inorganic matter."&lt;ref&gt; Stiegler has more recently stated that  can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." &lt;/ref&gt;
Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a  or wooden , or more complex machines, such as a  or . Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as  and s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology", it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. " technology" refers to the  available to humanity in any field.
Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of  technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and, as a result, has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of  has, at its basis, the development of the  and the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate  and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both  and , each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.
The distinction between science, engineering and technology is not always clear.  is the  investigation or study of phenomena, aimed at discovering enduring principles among elements of the  world by employing  techniques such as the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as ,  and .
Engineering is the  process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, , , and  knowledge, to achieve some practical result.
Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering &#8212; although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of s in s, by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines, such as s, s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact relations between  in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of , for example, in the United States it was widely considered that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in 's treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science&#8212;The Endless Frontier'': "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research." In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious&#8212;though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of tools by  was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a  of   which were already ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and  emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of '''' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of  making, known as the  "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in  within the , dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the '''', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of  approximately 12,000 years ago.
To make a stone tool, a "" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as ) was struck with a . This flaking produced a sharp edge on the core stone as well as on the flakes, either of which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of  or .&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their  lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including butchering carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the ); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its ; and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest stone tools were crude, being little more than a fractured rock. In the  era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as s emerged. The , approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the , where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The , beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of , where a wood, bone, or antler  could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple  source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the  suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1,000,000BC;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly consensus indicates that  had controlled fire by between 500,000BC and 400,000BC.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Fire, fueled with  and , allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were  and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380,000BC, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to 
out of Africa by 200,000BC and into other continents, such as .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Man's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the  period ("New stone age"). The invention of polished s was a major advance because it allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. The discovery of  allowed for the feeding of larger populations, and the transition to a  lifestyle increased the number of children that could be simultaneously raised, as young children no longer needed to be carried, as was the case with the nomadic lifestyle. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as , and the first civilizations, such as , is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly  social structures, the specialization of labor, trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges, such as the building of  and s, are all thought to have played a role.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Continuing improvements led to the  and  and provided the ability to  and  native metals (naturally occurring in relatively pure form).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , , , and , were such early metals. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of  times (about 8000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of  such as  and  (about 4000 BC). The first uses of iron alloys such as  dates to around 1400 BC.
Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the Nile annual floods to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and 'catch' basins. Similarly, the early peoples of Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, learned to use the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for much the same purposes. But more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention.
According to archaeologists, the  was invented around 4000 B.C. probably independently and nearly-simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day ), the Northern Caucasus () and Central Europe. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 B.C., with most experts putting it closer to 4000 B.C. The oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 B.C.; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. There is also evidence from the same period of time that wheels were used for the production of . (Note that the original potter's wheel was probably not a wheel, but rather an irregularly shaped slab of flat wood with a small hollowed or pierced area near the center and mounted on a peg driven into the earth. It would have been rotated by repeated tugs by the potter or his assistant.) More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The invention of the wheel revolutionized activities as disparate as transportation, war, and the production of pottery (for which it may have been first used). It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads and fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery. But it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.
Innovations continued through the  with innovations such as , the  and s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the .  saw the use of s (such as the , the , and the ) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the , s and s. The  brought forth many of these innovations, including the  (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with , beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the  was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of , , ,  and , driven by the discovery of . Technology later took another step with the harnessing of  to create such innovations as the ,  and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for , and advancements in , ,  and . The rise in technology has led to the construction of s and large cities whose inhabitants rely on s or other powered transit for transportation. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the , ,  and . The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the , , , and .
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In , the discovery of  has led to both  and .  were also invented and later  utilizing s and s. The technology behind got called , and these advancements subsequently led to the creation of the , which ushered in the current . Humans have also been able to  with s (later used for ) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as  and later  along with new  and treatments. Complex  and  techniques and organizations are needed to construct and maintain these new technologies, and entire  have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education &#8212; their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including , , and , and other fields have been made more complex, such as ,  and .
Generally,  is a reliance or confidence in technology as a benefactor of society. Taken to extreme, technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as ,&lt;ref name="Monsma 1986"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher .
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as  and , which view  as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of  and  and fear the notion of  and  which they support. Some have described  as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like  and , who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.
Many, such as the Luddites and prominent philosopher , hold serious, although not entirely deterministic reservations, about technology (see "&lt;ref name="Heidegger 1977"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;)". According to Heidegger scholars  and Charles Spinosa, "Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology,'' in The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays, trans. W. Lovitt, New York, Harper Torchbooks, 1977, pp. 25&#8211;6.&lt;/ref&gt;" What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, "Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday," in Nikolas Kompridis, ed. ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 265-281.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics, for example 's '''' and other writings, 's '''', and 's ''''. And, in '''' by , Faust's selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world, is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction, such as those by  and , and films (e.g. , ) project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.
The late cultural critic  distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and, finally, what he called "technopolies," that is, societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress, to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Postman, ''Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology'', New York: Vintage, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
Darin Barney has written about technology's impact on practices of  and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make  questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;Darin Barney, ''One Nation Under Google'', Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
 has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as , ,  and . He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. , , , and ).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf Nikolas Kompridis, "Technology's Challenge to Democracy," ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another prominent critic of technology is , who has published books ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.
Another, more infamous anti-technological treatise is '''', written by  (aka The ) and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure.
The notion of , however, was developed in the 20th century (e.g., see the work of ) to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized  or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The  movement emerged in part due to this concern.
In 1983 a classified program was initiated in the  to reverse the US declining economic and military competitiveness.  The program, , used all source intelligence to review competitiveness worldwide for all forms of competition to determine the source of the US decline.  What Project Socrates determined was that technology exploitation is the foundation of all  and that the source of the US declining competitiveness was the fact that decision-making through the US both in the private and public sectors had switched from decision making that was based on technology exploitation (i.e., technology-based planning) to decision making that was based on money exploitation (i.e., economic-based planning) at the end of World War II.
Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.
Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., , , ) and it what was used to transform the US into a . It was not economic-based planning.
Project Socrates determined that to rebuild US competitiveness, decision making throughout the US had to readopt technology-based planning.  Project Socrates also determined that countries like China and India had continued executing technology-based (while the US took its detour into economic-based) planning, and as a result had considerable advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers.  To rebuild US competitiveness the US decision-makers needed adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by China and India.
Project Socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap, the Automated Innovation Revolution, was poised to occur.  In the Automated Innovation Revolution the process for determining how to acquire and utilize technology for a competitive advantage (which includes R&amp;D) is automated so that it can be executed with unprecedented speed, efficiency and agility.
Project Socrates developed the means for automated innovation so that the US could lead the Automated Innovation Revolution in order to rebuild and maintain the country's economic competitiveness for many generations.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as s, some  communities,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs.
The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, s and s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; West African s also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as do s of , Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16426-nutcracking-monkeys-find-the-right-tool-for-the-job.html Nut-cracking monkeys find the right tool for the job], New Scientist, 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
 often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the  and science of the time.

A '''computer''' is a general purpose device that can be  to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a  (CPU) and some form of . The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.
The first electronic  computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern s (PCs).&lt;ref&gt;In 1946,  required an estimated 174kW. By comparison, a modern laptop computer may use around 30W; nearly six thousand times less.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this era   were used for military applications.
Modern computers based on s are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.&lt;ref&gt;Early computers such as  and  were able to process between 5 and 100 operations per second. A modern &#8220;&#8221;  (as of 2007) can process billions of operations per second, and many of these operations are more complicated and useful than early computer operations.
&lt;/ref&gt; Simple computers are small enough to fit into s, and  can be powered by small . Personal computers in their various forms are s of the  and are what most people think of as &#8220;computers.&#8221; However, the  found in many devices from  to  and from toys to s are the most numerous.
The first use of the word &#8220;computer&#8221; was recorded in 1613 in a book called &#8220;The yong mans gleanings&#8221; by English writer Richard Braithwait ''I haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number''. It referred to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.&lt;ref name=OEDComputer&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies, automated calculation and programmability. However no single device can be identified as the earliest computer, partly because of the inconsistent application of that term. A few devices are worth mentioning though, like some mechanical aids to computing, which were very successful and survived for centuries until the advent of the , like the , designed around 2500 BC&lt;ref&gt;*  From 2700 to 2300 BC, , pp.11&lt;/ref&gt; of which a descendant won a speed competition against a modern desk calculating machine in Japan in 1946,&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; the s, invented in the 1620s, which were carried on five  space missions, including to the moon&lt;ref&gt;According to advertising on Pickett's N600 slide rule boxes.&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably the  and the , an ancient astronomical computer built by the  around 80 BC.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician  (c. 10&#8211;70 AD) built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums that might be considered to be a means of deciding which parts of the mechanism performed which actions and when.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is the essence of programmability.
Around the end of the 10th century, the French monk  brought back from Spain the drawings of a machine invented by the  that answered either Yes or No to the questions it was asked.&lt;ref name=Felt-8&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Again in the 13th century, the monks  and  built talking  without any further development (Albertus Magnus complained that he had wasted forty years of his life when , terrified by his machine, destroyed it).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1642, the  saw  of the ,&lt;ref name=Felt-10&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; a device that could perform all four arithmetic operations without relying on human intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;&#8220;Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures&#8221; [http://books.google.fr/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arithmometer&amp;f=false The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100]&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical calculator was at the root of the development of computers in two separate ways. Initially, it was in trying to develop more powerful and more flexible calculators&lt;ref&gt;Babbage's  in 1823 and his  in the mid-1830s&lt;/ref&gt; that the computer was first theorized by &lt;ref&gt;&#8220;It is reasonable to inquire, therefore, whether it is possible to devise a machine which will do for mathematical computation what the automatic lathe has done for engineering. The first suggestion that such a machine could be made came more than a hundred years ago from the mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage's ideas have only been properly appreciated in the last ten years, but we now realize that he understood clearly all the fundamental principles which are embodied in modern digital computers&#8221; ''Faster than thought'', edited by B. V. Bowden, 1953, Pitman publishing corporation
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&#8220;...Among this extraordinary galaxy of talent Charles Babbage appears to be one of the most remarkable of all. Most of his life he spent in an entirely unsuccessful attempt to make a machine which was regarded by his contemporaries as utterly preposterous, and his efforts were regarded as futile, time-consuming and absurd. In the last decade or so we have learnt how his ideas can be embodied in a modern digital computer. He understood more about the logic of these machines than anyone else in the world had learned until after the end of the last war.&#8221; Foreword, ''Irascible Genius, Charles Babbage, inventor'' by Maboth Moseley, 1964, London, Hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed.&lt;ref&gt;In the proposal that Aiken gave IBM in 1937 while requesting funding for the  we can read: &#8220;Few '''calculating machines''' have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him... After abandoning the difference engine, Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an analytical engine of far higher powers than the difference engine... Since the time of Babbage, the development of '''calculating machinery''' has continued at an increasing rate.&#8221; , ''Proposed automatic calculating machine'', reprinted in: The origins of Digital computers, Selected Papers, Edited by Brian Randell, 1973, ISBN 3-540-06169-X&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, development of a low-cost , successor to the mechanical calculator, resulted in the development by &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the first commercially available  integrated circuit.
In 1801,  made an improvement to the  by introducing a series of  as a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically. The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early, albeit limited, form of programmability.
It was the fusion of automatic calculation with programmability that produced the first recognizable computers. In 1837,  was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable , his .&lt;ref&gt;The analytical engine should not be confused with Babbage's  which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; Limited finances and Babbage's inability to resist tinkering with the design meant that the device was never completed&#8212;nevertheless his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the ''mill'') in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906. This machine was given to the  in 1910.
In the late 1880s,  invented the recording of data on a machine-readable medium. Earlier uses of machine-readable media had been for control, not data. &#8220;After some initial trials with , he settled on punched cards...&#8221;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To process these punched cards he invented the , and the  machines. These three inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry. Large-scale automated data processing of punched cards was performed for the  by Hollerith's company, which later became the core of . By the end of the 19th century a number of ideas and technologies, that would later prove useful in the realization of practical computers, had begun to appear: , the  (thermionic valve), punched cards and tape, and the .
During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific  needs were met by increasingly sophisticated s, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for . However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.
 is widely regarded as the father of modern . In 1936, Turing provided an influential formalization of the concept of the  and  with the , providing a blueprint for the electronic digital computer.&lt;ref name=DSW/&gt; Of his role in the creation of the modern computer, '''' magazine in naming Turing one of the  people of the 20th century, states: &#8220;The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.&#8221;&lt;ref name=DSW&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The  (ABC) was the world's first electronic digital computer, albeit not .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Atanasoff is considered to be one of the fathers of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived in 1937 by Iowa State College physics professor , and built with the assistance of graduate student ,&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the machine was not programmable, being designed only to solve systems of linear equations. The computer did employ parallel computation. A  found that the patent for the 1946  computer derived from the Atanasoff&#8211;Berry Computer.
The first program-controlled computer was invented by , who built the , an electromechanical computing machine, in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first programmable electronic computer was the , built in 1943 by .
 is internationally recognized as a father of the modern digital computer. While working at Bell Labs in November 1937, Stibitz invented and built a relay-based calculator he dubbed the &#8220;Model K&#8221; (for &#8220;kitchen table,&#8221; on which he had assembled it), which was the first to use  circuits to perform . Later models added greater sophistication including complex arithmetic and programmability.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible  devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features that are seen in modern computers. The use of digital electronics (largely invented by  in 1937) and more flexible programmability were vitally important steps, but defining one point along this road as &#8220;the first digital electronic computer&#8221; is difficult. Notable achievements include:
*'s  &#8220;Z machines.&#8221; The  (1941) was the first working machine featuring  arithmetic, including floating point arithmetic and a measure of programmability. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be , therefore being the world's first operational computer.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*The non-programmable  (commenced in 1937, completed in 1941) which used vacuum tube based , binary numbers, and . The use of regenerative memory allowed it to be much more compact than its peers (being approximately the size of a large desk or workbench), since intermediate results could be stored and then fed back into the same set of computation elements.
*The secret British s (1943),&lt;ref&gt;B. Jack Copeland, ed., Colossus: The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers, Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of tubes could be reasonably reliable and electronically re-programmable. It was used for  German wartime codes.
*The  (1944), a large-scale electromechanical computer with limited programmability.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*The U.S. Army's   (1946), which used  arithmetic and is sometimes called the first general purpose  computer (since 's  of 1941 used s instead of ). Initially, however, ENIAC had an architecture which required rewiring a  to change its programming.
Several developers of ENIAC, recognizing its flaws, came up with a far more flexible and elegant design, which came to be known as the &#8220;stored-program architecture&#8221; or . This design was first formally described by  in the paper '''', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture commenced around this time, the first of which was completed in 1948 at the  in England, the  (SSEM or &#8220;Baby&#8221;). The  (EDSAC), completed a year after the SSEM at Cambridge University, was the first practical, non-experimental implementation of the stored-program design and was put to use immediately for research work at the university. Shortly thereafter, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper&#8212;&#8212;was completed but did not see full-time use for an additional two years.
Nearly all modern computers implement some form of the stored-program architecture, making it the single trait by which the word &#8220;computer&#8221; is now defined. While the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic, general-purpose computers of the 1940s, most still use the von Neumann architecture.
Beginning in the 1950s,  scientists  and  conducted research on s, devices that operated on a base three numbering system of -1, 0, and 1 rather than the conventional ing system upon which most computers are based. They designed the , a functional ternary computer, at . The device was put into limited production in the Soviet Union, but supplanted by the more common binary architecture.
Computers using s as their electronic elements were in use throughout the 1950s, but by the 1960s they had been largely replaced by -based machines, which were smaller, faster, cheaper to produce, required less power, and were more reliable. The first transistorized computer was demonstrated at the  in 1953.&lt;ref name=LavingtonP37&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s,  technology and the subsequent creation of s, such as the , further decreased size and cost and further increased speed and reliability of computers. By the late 1970s, many products such as  contained dedicated computers called s, and they started to appear as a replacement to mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as s. The 1980s witnessed s and the now ubiquitous personal computer. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household.
Modern s are fully programmable computers in their own right, and as of 2009 may well be the most common form of such computers in existence.
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be . That is to say that some type of  (the ) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the  often have machine code in the form of an .
In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for s and s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second () and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of s years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.
This section applies to most common -based computers.
In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's  and are generally carried out () in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called &#8220;jump&#8221; instructions (or ). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen  so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support s by providing a type of jump that &#8220;remembers&#8221; the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.
Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the  within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.
Comparatively, a person using a pocket  can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. For example:
       mov No. 0, sum     ; set sum to 0
       mov No. 1, num     ; set num to 1
 loop: add num, sum    ; add num to sum
       add No. 1, num     ; add 1 to num
       cmp num, #1000  ; compare num to 1000
       ble loop        ; if num &lt;= 1000, go back to 'loop'
       halt            ; end of program. stop running
Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.&lt;ref&gt;This program was written similarly to those for the   and shows some typical things a computer can do. All the text after the semicolons are  for the benefit of human readers. These have no significance to the computer and are ignored. &lt;/ref&gt;
Errors in computer programs are called &#8220;.&#8221; They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to &#8220;,&#8221; becoming unresponsive to input such as  clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to . Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an , code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.&lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the  caused some  s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain  division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;
 is credited for having first used the term &#8220;bugs&#8221; in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the  computer in September 1947.&lt;ref name="taylor84"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In most computers, individual instructions are stored as  with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or  for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode, the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the  after the  computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in s.
While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers () and while this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some s like the   could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the  process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some .&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&#8211; a  such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's . Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into  by a  or an  before being run, or translated directly at run time by an . Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed ''low-level programming languages'') tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an  computer (such as may be found in a  or a ) cannot understand the machine language of an  or the  computer that might be in a .&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An  compatible microprocessor like the   is able to run most of the same programs that an  microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel s and . This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract s that are able to express the needs of the  more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually &#8220;compiled&#8221; into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a .&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often  rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an .&lt;/ref&gt; High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various s.
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large  systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of  concentrates specifically on this challenge.
A general purpose computer has four main components: the  (ALU), the , the , and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by , often made of groups of s.
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small  which can be turned off or on by means of an . Each circuit represents a  (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a &#8220;1&#8221;, and when off it represents a &#8220;0&#8221; (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in s so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.
The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these) are collectively known as a  (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single  called a ''''.
The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into a series of control signals which activate other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Many computers include some instructions that may only be partially interpreted by the control system and partially interpreted by another device. This is especially the case with specialized computing hardware that may be partially self-contained. For example, , one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.
A key component common to all CPUs is the , a special memory cell (a ) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;
The control system's function is as follows&#8212;note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:
# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).
Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as &#8220;jumps&#8221; and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of ).
The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a , which runs a  program that causes all of these events to happen.
The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division,  functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and s. Some can only operate on whole numbers (s) whilst others use  to represent s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation&#8212;although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return  (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (&#8220;is 64 greater than 65?&#8221;).
Logic operations involve : , ,  and . These can be useful for creating complicated  and processing .
 computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  and computers with  and  features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on  and .
A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered &#8220;address&#8221; and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to &#8220;put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357&#8221; or to &#8220;add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.&#8221; The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.
In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store  in groups of eight bits (called a ). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or &#8722;128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in  notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.
The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called  that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.
Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties:  or RAM and  or ROM. RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the  that orchestrates loading the computer's  from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In , which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called , because it is notionally more like hardware than software.  blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. &lt;/ref&gt;
In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM , which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.
I/O is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and , and output devices such as the  and . s,  and s serve as both input and output devices.  is another form of I/O.
I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory. A  might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display . Modern s contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O.
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an , which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running &#8220;at the same time,&#8221; then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed &#8220;time-sharing&#8221; since each program is allocated a &#8220;slice&#8221; of time in turn.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.
Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a &#8220;time slice&#8221; until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as s, s and . Multiprocessor and  (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called s]] can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. &lt;/ref&gt; They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale , , and  applications, as well as with other so-called &#8220;&#8221; tasks.
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's  system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now ), and the  that resulted was called the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.
In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the , combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like  and  saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. &#8220;Wireless&#8221; networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

 are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above  or  paradigms.
The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called  makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from s. The  is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a  is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore any type of computer (, , , etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.
A computer does not need to be , nor even have a , nor , nor even a . While popular usage of the word &#8220;computer&#8221; is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern&lt;ref&gt;According to the '''' (6th ed, 2007), the word ''computer'' dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to &#8220;A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc.&#8221;&lt;/ref&gt; definition of a computer is literally &#8220;''A device that computes'', especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.&#8221;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Any device which ''processes information'' qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.
Historically, computers evolved from s and eventually from s to s. However, conceptually computational systems as  as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls (); an often quoted example. More realistically, modern computers are made out of  made of  .
There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as , , , and . Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any , and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by ) very quickly.

A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of  and .
The term ''hardware'' covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible objects. Circuits, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and mice are all hardware.

<doc id="21830" rev_id="551427841" title="Nature">:''"Natural" and "Natural World" redirect here. For other uses, see  and .''
'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the '''natural world''', '''physical world''', or '''material world'''. "Nature" refers to the  of the physical world, and also to  in general. It ranges in scale from the  to the .
The word ''nature'' is derived from the  word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' was a Latin translation of the Greek word '''' (&#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;A useful though somewhat erratically presented account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; may be found in Naddaf, Gerard ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2006. The word &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962;, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by  in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: &#8035;&#962; &#7940;&#961;&#945; &#966;&#969;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#960;&#972;&#961;&#949; &#966;&#940;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#970;&#966;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#954; &#947;&#945;&#943;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#961;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#943; &#956;&#959;&#953; '''&#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#957;''' &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7956;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#958;&#949;. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) '''' 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical , is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word &#966;&#973;&#963;&#953;&#962; by  philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern  in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's  (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: &lt;/ref&gt;
Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to  and . Nature may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects &#8211; the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the  and  of the Earth, and the  and  of which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the "" or &#8211;wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human  or a human . Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the , the , or .
 (or, "the earth") is the only  presently known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the , it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest  and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow  zones, and a wide ial  to  region.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the .
Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The  is divided into several gradually migrating s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic  and an iron-filled core that generates a .
The  conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by  and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Geology is the  and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the . The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, , , dynamics, and  of , and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major , and is also important for  and  extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of s, some  fields, and understanding  and environments.
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.
Rock units are first emplaced either by  onto the surface or intrude into the . Deposition can occur when s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later  into , or when as  such as  or  flows, blanket the surface. Igneous s such as s, s, s, and , push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.
After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be  and/or . Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, , or side-to-side () motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to , , and , respectively, between .
Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the , along with the  and other s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and  activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing , most or all of which came from  delivered by s,  and other water sources.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a . Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent , began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form  which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally , which broke apart about 180million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
There is significant evidence that a severe  action during the  era covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed the "", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the  in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530&#8211;540million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The last mass extinction occurred some 65 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the  s and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as s, which then resembled s. Over the past 65million years, mammalian life diversified.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Several million years ago, a species of small African  gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further  allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the , produced by the proliferation of  during the  period, required about 300million years to culminate.
The present era is classified as part of a mass , the  event, the fastest ever to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as  of , predict that human destruction of the  could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/holmass.html], [http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/extincmenu.html], [http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/patterns.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary . The thin layer of es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry  consists of 78% , 21% , 1%  and other , carbon dioxide, etc.; but air also contains a variable amount of . The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude, and has a  of about 8 kilometres at the Earth's surface: the height at which the atmospheric pressure has declined by a factor of '''' (a mathematical constant
equal to 2.71...).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of  (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As  is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.
Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the , and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater  which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in  between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the s much colder.
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as es or s and s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.
The planetary climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to , including ocean currents, surface , es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the planet's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including s.
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially . A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the  at the equator to the  in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the , which result from the 's  being  relative to its . Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the . This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the  and  hemispheres experience opposite seasons.
Weather is a  that is readily modified by small changes to the , so accurate  is currently limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are currently happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Water''' is a  that is composed of  and  and is vital for all known forms of .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In typical usage, ''water'' refers only to its  form or , but the substance also has a  state, , and a  state,  or . Water covers 71% of the 's surface.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in s and 0.001% in the  as , s (formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and .&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System], Special Report, American Geophysical Union, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080220070111/http://www.unep.org/dewa/assessments/ecosystems/water/vitalwater/ Vital Water]. .&lt;/ref&gt; s hold 97% of surface water, s and polar s 2.4%, and other land surface water such as s, s and s 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.
An  is a major body of , and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's  (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a  that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800ft) deep. Average oceanic  is around 35  (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the  or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet]".

"Maps of the whole world ocean." ''Geographical Review'' (). Vol. 32 (3): pp. 431&#8211;5.&lt;/ref&gt;
The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the s, various s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the , the , the , the  and the . Smaller regions of the oceans are called s, , s and other names. There are also s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the  and the .
A  (from Latin ''lacus'') is a  (or ), a body of  on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of  (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the , is larger and deeper than a , and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is , Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of , most likely mixed with . It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, s, and areas with ongoing or recent . Other lakes are found in s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last . All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
A '''pond''' is a  of , either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a . A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, s designed for commercial fish breeding, and s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via  speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven microcurrents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as s and s.
A  is a natural ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually , flowing toward an , a , a  or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including , creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=river&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h= River], Wordnet&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS &#8211; U.S. Geological Survey &#8211; faqs], #17 What is the difference between , , and ;  and ; or river and ?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the . Water within a river is generally collected from  through ,  recharge, , and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from s).
A stream is a flowing body of water with a , confined within a  and s. In the  a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the , instruments in , and they serve as corridors for  and  migration. The biological  in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a . Given the status of the ongoing , streams play an important  role in connecting s and thus in conserving . The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including , , , ,  and others.
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of  and  components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: , atmosphere, radiation from the , water, and living organisms.
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that s interact with every other element in their local . Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the , and exchange  and  between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The human ecosystem concept is grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature  and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their .
A smaller unit of size is called a . For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole , with its .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by  activity. [http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ The WILD Foundation] goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: "The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet &#8211; those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure." Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , s and even in s along rivers, gulches or otherwise s. [http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ Wilderness areas] and protected  are considered important for the survival of certain , ecological studies, , solitude, and . Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155-157, ISBN 1559634650.&lt;/ref&gt; and some s consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the planet's self-sustaining natural  (the ). They may also preserve historic  traits and that they provide  for wild  and  that may be difficult to recreate in s, s or .
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by , , , , response to  and .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of s.
Properties common to terrestrial organisms (s, s, , s,  and ) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made  may also be considered to be life.
The  is the part of Earth's outer shell&#8211; including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&#8211; within which life occurs, and which  processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest  point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the  (rocks),  (water), and  (air). Currently the entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;s) of  (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., , which takes global average weight as 60kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5 billion (see, ''e.g.'', ): Assuming 60&#8211;70kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130&#8211;150 on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390 billion (390&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455 billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million&#8211;488million s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;
Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Animal." World Book Encyclopedia. 16 vols. Chicago: World Book, 2003. This source gives an estimate of from 2 to 50million.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.&lt;ref&gt; Website based on the contents of the book: &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of species is presently in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Life is only known to exist on the planet Earth.(cf ) The  is still a poorly understood process, but it is thought to have occurred about 3.9 to 3.5billion years ago during the  or  eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.&lt;ref name=Line&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of  by  resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.
Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the  record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and  evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&lt;ref name=Line/&gt;
The advent of  in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy to be harvested to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant  accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the . The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the  called .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful , life colonized the surface of Earth.
The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life on the planet until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally , and smaller than the human eye can see. They include , ,  and .
These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including the interior of rocks within the planet.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse. The combination of a high mutation rate and a &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem. However some microorganisms are  and can post health risk to other organisms.
Originally  divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In ' system, these became the   (later ) and ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the  and several groups of e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.
Among the many ways of classifying  are by regional s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and .
Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.
Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.
s as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are  and usually  (although see ), which separates them from ,  and most s. They are ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from s and e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and  by lacking s.
With a few exceptions, most notably the  (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differentiated into separate . These include s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a , which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal  chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of  and elastic s. This may be calcified to form structures like , s, and s, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.
Although humans currently comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is presently diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.
The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human  remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include , , and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the  of many plants and animals.
Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains the primary component of the world's economic system.  Some activities, such as  and , are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.  was first adopted around the . Ranging from food production to , nature influences economic wealth.
Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much , ,  and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, is studied by the branch of philosophy called . Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a range of opinions, see:  and 's analysis of the subject: &lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various s of world history. An early tradition of  began in  during the  (618&#8211;907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of  and was a significant influence in Asian art.
Although natural wonders are celebrated in the  and the ,  portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the .  artists  and  turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. 's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the  in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word , the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical  and more generally by . As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Some fields of  see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""&#8211; the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.
Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the . The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 23 percent  and 73 percent .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of these components is still unknown and is currently under intensive investigation by physicists.
The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined s. These laws have been employed to produce  models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty s&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that appear to be static across the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the  outside the s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from  (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the  and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the  is called , which passes over into  at what is known as the .
Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of  s discovered to date by ,  left over from the  and the origin of the universe, and s, which include ized  and various s. There is also some gas,  and , and small s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this  re-enters the atmosphere periodically.
Although the planet Earth is currently the only known body within the solar system to support life, current evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet  possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Conditions on the other terrestrial planets,  and , appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.  But it has been conjectured that , the fourth-largest moon of , may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently, the team of  have discovered a new planet named , which is an  orbiting the   .  Gliese 581 g appears to lie in the  of space surrounding the , and therefore could possibly host  as we know it.

OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com.

Art has been characterized in terms of , expression, communication of emotion, or other values. During the , art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html What Is Art?]&lt;/ref&gt; and creation through imaginative or technical skill.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/630806/art art - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;
The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of  known as .&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy : readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, pp. xi&#8211;xiii. ISBN 0-312-05391-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
By a broad definition of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as kind: from early  to ; however, some theories restrict the concept to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (Dec. 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; The first and broadest sense of ''art'' is the one that has remained closest to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft." A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', '' arts'', and '' arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its .
In medieval philosophy,  held that "the name of art should be applied to those only which contribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life." , when treating the adornment of women, gives an  justification as to why: "In the case of an art directed to the production of goods which men cannot use without sin, it follows that the workmen sin in making such things, as directly affording others an occasion of sin; for instance, if a man were to make idols or anything pertaining to idolatrous worship. But in the case of an art the products of which may be employed by man either for a good or for an evil use, such as swords, arrows, and the like, the practice of such an art is not sinful. These alone should be called arts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Modesty in the outward apparel (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 169)]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas held that art is nothing else than "the right reason about certain works to be made," and that it is commendable, not for the will with which a craftman does a work, "but for the quality of the work. Art, therefore, properly speaking, is an operative habit."  and Aquinas distinguish it from the related habit of .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2057.htm#article3 SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The intellectual virtues (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 57)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The second and more recent sense of the word ''art'' is as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' and emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;. '''', Oxford 1993, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist's , or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the ''finer'' things.
The word ''art'' can refer to several things: a study of creative skill, a process of using the creative skill, a product of the creative skill, or the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines that produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the viewer to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. Although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the "creation" of something new, this represents science only and is not categorized as art.
Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered  instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and  are sometimes considered . Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, "The Boundaries of Art", 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of  (see ); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.
The nature of art has been described by philosopher  as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p.1, 2nd edn, 1980, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29706-0&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating  for their own sake, and as '''' or .

Vol. 1: Briefe der Jahre 1764-1786.

ISBN 0-19-927945-4&lt;/ref&gt;  and  advanced the  view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford university Press, 2003, p16.

Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp 36&#8211;43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of , and was developed in the early twentieth century by  and .  More recently, thinkers influenced by  have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;, "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001).

Sculptures, , rock paintings and  from the  dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world&#8212;a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old&#8212;were discovered in a South African cave.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Tim.

Retrieved on January 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: , , , India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as , , and . Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.
In  and  of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of Biblical and religious truths, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.
 had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of  to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.
In the east, 's rejection of  led to emphasis on geometric patterns, , and . Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning  of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example,  paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but  paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting.  became important in Japan after the 17th century.
The western  in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as 's portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or 's propagandistic paintings. This led to  rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of . The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as , ,  and  among others.
The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of , , , , , , etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing  interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by . Japanese woodblock prints (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by . Similarly, the west has had huge impacts on Eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries, with originally western ideas like  and  exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles.
Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability.   said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt;  was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of  and , where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony. Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than regional cultures.
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, each related to its technique, or , such as s, , , or . Unlike scientific fields, art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique [http://www.rchoetzlein.com/quanta/theory/theory-new-media.htm]. An artistic  is the substance or material the artistic work is made from, and may also refer to the technique used. For example, paint is a medium used in painting, and paper is a medium used in drawing.
An '''''art form''''' is the specific ''shape'', or quality an artistic expression takes. The media used often influence the form. For example, the  of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions, and respond to gravity. The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its '''''formal qualities'''''. To give another example, the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture, color, and brush texture. The formal qualities of video games are non-linearity, interactivity and virtual presence.
The ''form'' of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media, and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are related to content rather than form.&lt;ref name=SaylorIntroPDF&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''''genre''''' is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium. For instance, well recognized genres in film are ,  and . Genres in music include  and . Genres in painting include  and . A particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions, clich&#233;s and tropes. (One note: the word ''genre'' has a second older meaning within painting; '''' was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way.)
The '''''style''''' of an artwork, artist, or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art. Any loose brushy, dripped or poured abstract painting is called ''expressionistic''. Often a style is linked with a particular historical period, set of ideas, and particular artistic movement. So  is called an .
A particular style may have specific cultural meanings. For example, &#8212;a painter associated with the American  movement of the 1960s&#8212;was not a , despite his use of dots. Lichtenstein used evenly spaced  (the type used to reproduce color in comic strips) as a style to question the "high" art of painting with the "low" art of comics, thus commenting on class distinctions in culture. Pointillism, a technique in late Impressionism (1880s) developed especially by the artist , employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color. Both artists use dots, but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist.
These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art, to narrow it down. "Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks. How would you proceed with your task? One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object, image video, or event. The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze, for instance, inevitably effects its meaning; the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate, even if everything else about the artwork remains the same. Next, you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes, colors, textures, and lines. These, in turn, are organized into various patterns and compositional structures. In your interpretation, you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork. [But in the end] the meaning of most artworks... is not exhausted by a discussion of materials, techniques, and form. Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 4. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a . Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a  to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art], Signs &#8211; International Journal of Semiotics 3, pp.1&#8211;28, 2010. ISSN: 1902-8822&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the  "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for , art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. 's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of  were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, , was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.
A common contemporary criticism of some  occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, 's "" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. 's ''My Bed'', or 's ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the . Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.
Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist), or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.
Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, 's painting depicting the Spanish shootings of  1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.
The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''''.
Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse  or  feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the ; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Levi-Strauss).
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.
# ''.'' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry." -Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. The Poetics, Republic. Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively. http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Experience of the mysterious.'' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. The World as I See It. http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Expression of the imagination.'' Art provide a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else &#8211; something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken." -Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Critique of Aesthetic Judgement (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.'' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'." -Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, "Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context": (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.
# ''Communication.'' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication." -Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art as entertainment''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.
# ''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.'' One of the defining functions of early twentieth century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal&#8212;Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others&#8212;are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;"By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life." -Andr&#233; Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;Andr&#233; Breton, Surrealist Manifesto (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art for psychological and healing purposes.'' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as . The , for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
# ''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.'' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.  and other types of  are graphics and images that are  or led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# ''Art for social causes.'' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , practiced by artists such as  is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution.
# ''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.'' Art is often utilized as a form of , and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;, Mythologies&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Art as a fitness indicator.'' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One  explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the 's tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also  and ). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;Dutton, Denis. 2003. 'Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology' in "The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics". Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.
Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.  Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the  are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a , though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as  made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality  and Greek s to a very wide market. s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the . Once s were widely used these also became an artform that reached the widest range of society.  Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when  began with small s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-coloured, and affordable even by s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.   of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.
, secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.  Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the , where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.
Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the  mostly housed in a wing of the  in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the  became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible.  The British  remains distinct, but large donations such as the  were made from it to the , established in 1753.  The  in  opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.  The building now occupied by the  in  was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in ,  and other capitals. The opening of the  during the  (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.
Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses ( in New York City, for example, was created by , a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.
There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as , , and . The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality, page 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view.  is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones.  is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of , where  remain especially controversial.  Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by s, though often much less so by a wider public.  The  content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the  in scenes of the .   by  was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of  through nudity and the -like pose of Christ.
The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of , and econonomic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance.  Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. 's '''' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. 's '''' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the  woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. 's '''' (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.
The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century.  In the twentieth century, 's '''' (1937) used arresting  techniques and stark , to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. 's ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. 's '''' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing 's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.
In the nineteenth century, artists were primarily concerned with ideas of ''truth'' and ''''. The aesthetic theorist , who championed what he saw as the naturalism of , saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all , rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth." . , Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century.  distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the , whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the , whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the  , whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, Essay VI. pp. 231&#8211;39.&lt;/ref&gt;
The arrival of  in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; N.Y.,1999. ISBN 0-415-06700-6&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of . 's 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of
painting&#8212;the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment&#8212;were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as , , ,  and  among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.
ists like  became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the . Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.
Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haon2DXWvLk Duchamp Two Statements - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this.  is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. . Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but . Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and  are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included ,  and  but also; , , , , ,  and  etc.
Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art.
Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included  and  paintings, 's '''', the , superlative imitations of , , and .&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon, "2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art", New York Times, Magazine Section, December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the  criticized 's and 's work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. "Contemporary Art and the Home". Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. ISBN 1-85973-661-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, , suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis ''[http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm Tribal Art]'' in '', edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

The '''Internet''' is a global system of interconnected s that use the standard  (''TCP/IP'') to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked  documents of the  (WWW) and the  to support email.
Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as  (VoIP) and  (IPTV). Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to  technology, or are reshaped into  and s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through , Internet forums, and .  has boomed both for major retail outlets and small s and traders.  and  on the Internet affect s across entire industries.
The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the  in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. The funding of a new U.S.  by the  in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The  of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. , more than 2.4 billion people&#8212;over a third of the &#8212;have used the services of the Internet.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal s in the Internet, the  space and the , are directed by a maintainer organization, the  (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ( and ) is an activity of the  (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.
The ''Internet'', referring to the specific global system of interconnected  networks, is a  and written with an initial . In the media and common use it is often not capitalized, viz. ''the internet.'' Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as a verb or an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch07/ch07_sec076.html?para= "7.76 Terms like 'web' and 'Internet'"], ''Chicago Manual of Style'', University of Chicago, 16th edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net''.
Historically the word ''internet'' was used, uncapitalized, as early as 1883 as a verb and adjective to refer to interconnected motions. Starting in the early 1970s the term ''internet'' was used as a shorthand form of the technical term , the result of interconnecting computer networks with special gateways or routers. It was also used as a verb meaning to connect together, especially for networks.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., gives nineteenth-century use and pre-Internet verb use&lt;/ref&gt; 
The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of "going on the Internet" when invoking a  to view s. However, the Internet is a particular global computer network connecting millions of computing devices; the  is just one of many  running on the Internet. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other s, linked by s and s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Web, a multitude of other services are implemented over the Internet, including , , , s, and s. Web (and other) services can be implemented on any , accessible to network users.
'''' is a mixture of ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' typically used sarcastically to parody a technically unsavvy user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=interweb Interweb], Urban Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
Research into  started in the early 1960s and packet switched networks such as Mark I at ,&lt;ref name="BBC Technology"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/article.php ''A Chronicle of Merit's Early History''], John Mulcahy, 1989, Merit Network, Ann Arbor, Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; , and , were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of . The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for , where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.
The first two nodes of what would become the  were interconnected between 's Network Measurement Center at the  and  NLS system at  (SRI) in , on 29 October 1969.&lt;ref name="NetValley"&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html "Roads and Crossroads of Internet History"] by Gregory Gromov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The third site on the ARPANET was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics center at the , and the fourth was the  Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, there were already fifteen sites connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These early years were documented in the 1972 film .
Early international collaborations on ARPANET were sparse. For various political reasons, European developers were concerned with developing the  networks.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Notable exceptions were the ''Norwegian Seismic Array'' () in June 1973,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the  Earth Station and 's research group in the UK, initially at the ,  and later at .
In December 1974, ''RFC 675&#8211; Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program'', by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, used the term ''internet'', as a shorthand for ''internetworking''; later  repeat this use, so the word started out as an  rather than the  it is today.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the  (NSF) developed the  (CSNET).  In 1982, the  (TCP/IP) was standardized and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the Internet was introduced.
TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network () provided access to  sites in the United States from research and education organizations, first at 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 1987-1995''], Karen D. Frazer, Merit Network, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial  (ISPs) began to emerge in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990. The Internet was commercialized in 1995 when NSFNET was decommissioned, removing the last restrictions on the use of the Internet to carry commercial traffic.&lt;ref name=ConneXions-April1996&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet started a rapid expansion to Europe and Australia in the mid to late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; (RIPE)&lt;/ref&gt; and to Asia in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the mid-1990s the Internet has had a tremendous impact on culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, ,  (VoIP) "phone calls", , and the &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5242252.stm How the web went world wide], Mark Ward, Technology Correspondent, BBC News. Retrieved 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with its , blogs, , and  sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31 March 2011, the estimated total number of  was 2.095billion (30.2% of world population).&lt;ref name="stats1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication, by 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. While the hardware can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the rigorous standardization process of the software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been delegated to the  (IETF).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting discussions and final standards are published in a series of publications, each called a  (RFC), freely available on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the s.  Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.
The Internet standards describe a framework known as the . This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols (RFC 1122, RFC 1123). The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the , the space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications, e.g., a web browser program.  Below this top layer, the  connects applications on ''different hosts'' via the network (e.g., ) with appropriate data exchange methods. Underlying these layers are the core networking technologies, consisting of two layers. The  enables computers to identify and locate each other via , and allows them to connect to one another via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture, is a software layer, the , that provides connectivity between hosts on the same local network link, such as a local area network () or a . The model, also known as , is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware, which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail.  Other models have been developed, such as the  (OSI) model, but they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation; many similarities exist and the TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.
The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems (es) for computers on the Internet. IP enables internetworking and in essence establishes the Internet itself.  IP Version 4 () is the initial version used on the first generation of today's Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to , which entered its final stage in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; when the global address allocation pool was exhausted.  A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic.  is currently in growing  around the world, since Internet address registries () began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
IPv6 is not interoperable with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for networking devices that need to communicate on both networks. Most modern computer operating systems already support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructures, however, are still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (e.g., s), and by technical specifications or protocols that describe how to exchange data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.
s connect customers (thought of at the "bottom" of the routing hierarchy) to customers of other ISPs. At the "top" of the routing hierarchy are ten or so s, large telecommunication companies which exchange traffic directly "across" to all other Tier 1 networks via unpaid  agreements. s buy  from other ISP to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in unpaid peering (especially for local partners of a similar size). ISPs can use a single "upstream" provider for connectivity, or use  to provide protection from problems with individual links.  s create physical connections between multiple ISPs, often hosted in buildings owned by independent third parties.
Computers and routers use s to direct IP packets among locally connected machines. Tables can be constructed manually or automatically via  for an individual computer or a  for routers themselves. In single-homed situations, a  usually points "up" toward an ISP providing transit. Higher-level ISPs use the  to sort out paths to any given  across the complex connections of the global Internet.
Academic institutions, large companies, governments, and other organizations can perform the same role as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks of individual computers. Research networks tend to interconnect into large subnetworks such as , , , and the UK's , . These in turn are built around smaller networks.
Not all  are connected to the Internet. For example, some s are only accessible from separate secure networks.
The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively. It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a "prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is heterogeneous; for instance, s and physical characteristics of connections vary widely. The Internet exhibits "" that depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates exhibit temporal . The principles of the routing and addressing methods for traffic in the Internet reach back to their origins in the 1960s when the eventual scale and popularity of the network could not be anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Maxymuk, John. "Internet". The Bottom Line, 1987, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the possibility of developing alternative structures is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet structure was found to be highly robust&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to random failures and very vulnerable to high degree attacks.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The Internet is a  comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. However, to maintain interoperability, the principal s of the Internet are administered by the  (ICANN), headquartered in . ICANN is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. 
ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet. The government of the United States continues to have a primary role in approving changes to the  that lies at the heart of the domain name system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/bush_net_policy/ "Bush administration annexes internet"], Kieren McCarthy, The Register, 1 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored , held in , established the  (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.
The technical underpinning and standardization of the Internet's core protocols ( and ) is an activity of the  (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.
The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through s. Mobile phones, s, s and s allow users to connect to the Internet ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.
Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from , through school and high-school revision guides and , to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of . For , help with  and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the  in particular are important enablers of both  and .
The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made  work dramatically easier, with the help of . Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the , which has produced, among other things, , , and . Internet chat, whether using an  chat room, an  system, or a  website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.
 systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and  spread.
The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily, wherever they may be. They may do this with or without , i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can  the books of a company based in another country, on a  situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using , or open a  session into their office PC using a secure  (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.
Many people use the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not . The  is a global set of ,  and other resources, logically interrelated by s and referenced with s (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, , and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide.  (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web, but it is only one of the hundreds of communication protocols used on the Internet. s also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.
World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft's , , , 's , and , lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of , including graphics, sounds, , ,  and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page.  can include animations, ,  and scientific demonstrations. Through -driven  using s like  and , users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.
The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to  ideas and information to a potentially large  online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial  and many cost-free services are available. Publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage  to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result. One example of this practice is , whose  publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as  and  have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as s rather than simply as web page hosts.
 on popular web pages can be lucrative, and  or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.
When the Web began in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in , ready to be sent to a user's browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become more automated and more dynamic. Websites are often created using  or  software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of a club or other organization or members of the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors view and read this content in its final HTML form.  There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.
Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents and other files are sent as s. Emails can be  to multiple es.
 is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet.  stands for Voice-over-, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with -like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as  or . VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.
Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include  dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no "extra features" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a  for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include  and . , , and  also offer VoIP chat features.
 is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A  can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or  server for easy download by others. It can be put into a "shared location" or onto a  for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of "" servers or  networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user , the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by , and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed&#8211; usually fully encrypted&#8211; across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by s or by  or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.
 is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet "broadcasters" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical s to on-demand popular multimedia services. ing is a variation on this theme, where&#8211; usually audio&#8211; material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a  to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.
Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the , traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video  and  are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a -based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Common methods of  in homes include dial-up, landline  (over ,  or copper wires), ,  and / technology . Public places to use the Internet include libraries and s, where computers with Internet connections are available. There are also  in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Various terms are used, such as "public Internet kiosk", "public access terminal", and "Web ". Many hotels now also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usage like ticket booking, bank deposit, online payment etc. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to computer networks, and therefore can do so to the Internet itself.  providing such access include , where would-be users need to bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or . These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A hotspot need not be limited to a confined location. A whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.
 efforts have led to s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in London, , , San Francisco, , Chicago and . The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like , various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as s in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as  are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used.&lt;ref&gt;"By 2013, mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common Web access device worldwide", according a forecast in [http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1278413 "Gartner Highlights Key Predictions for IT Organizations and Users in 2010 and Beyond"], Gartner, Inc., 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.
An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the .  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of , as in the blockage of the , whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name="renesys1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/ Internet users graphs], Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion  searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a . Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the  (ASCII), a subset of the .
After English (27%), the most requested languages on the  are Chinese (23%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats], updated for 30 June 2010.

However, some glitches such as '''' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.
In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.&lt;ref&gt;How men and women use the Internet Pew Research Center 28 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Euromonitor, by 2020 43.7% of the world's population will be users of the Internet. Splitting by country, in 2011 Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands had the highest internet penetration by the number of users, with more than 90% of the population with access.
The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access. In the first decade of the 21st century, the first generation is raised with widespread availability of Internet connectivity, bringing consequences and concerns in areas such as personal privacy and identity, and distribution of copyrighted materials.  These "" face a variety of challenges that were not present for prior generations.
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People use , messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had s. The Internet has seen a growing number of s, where users can access their files and settings via the Internet.
 websites such as , , and  have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like  foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and  specialize in users' videos and photographs.
The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining s such as s and s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related  groups receiving much traffic. Today, many  have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of  are also popular. Over 6million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The  and  industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html "Internet Pornography Statistics"], Jerry Ropelato, Top Ten Reviews, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/SmallBiz/story?id=4151592 "Do It Yourself!

Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.
Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the "" thread.
 is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M.

Remote work is facilitated by tools such as , , , , and  (VOIP). It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As  Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate  and internal phone networks.
Internet provides a particularly good venue for crowdsourcing ( tasks to a distributed group of people) since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing.
Crowdsourcing systems are used to accomplish a variety of tasks. For example, the crowd may be invited to develop a new technology, carry out a design task, refine or carry out the steps of an algorithm (see ), or help capture, systematize, or analyze large amounts of data (see also ).
s have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on , , departmental documentation, and committee work.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding  relevant to examination of pending patent applications. , New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park.&lt;ref name=Noveck&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was thoroughly explored by  in his thesis of 2004: 
Berdal, therefore, extends the  notion of the  to the Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that intervowen Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the Internet, Berdal also notes how "self-protective measures" are put in place by those threatened by it: 
The spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for  charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals.  Websites, such as  and , allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.
A popular twist on internet-based philanthropy is the use of  for charitable purposes.  pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary  organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 &amp; 16 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the recent spread of low cost Internet access in  has made genuine international person-to-person  philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit  tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ "Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some governments, such as those of , , , the , , and the  restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet, especially political and religious content. This is accomplished through software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187 ''Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace''], Ronald J.

In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily, possibly to avoid such an arrangement being turned into law, agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden URLs is supposed to contain addresses of only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.&lt;ref name="The Register"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as , via the Internet, but do not mandate filtering software. There are many free and commercially available software programs, called , with which a user can choose to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit a child's access to pornographic materials or depiction of violence.

'''Biology''' is a  concerned with the study of  and , including their structure, function, growth, , distribution, and .&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.]&lt;/ref&gt; Biology has many  unified by five so-called s of modern biology:&lt;ref name="avila_biology"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Subdisciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied and the methods used to study them:  examines the rudimentary chemistry of life;  studies the complex interactions among biological s;  examines the basic building block of all life, the ;  examines the physical and chemical functions of , , and s of an organism;  examines the  that produced the diversity of life; and  examines how organisms interact in their .&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.weber.edu/sciencemuseum/pages/life_main.asp Life Science, Weber State Museum of Natural Science]&lt;/ref&gt;
The term '''' is derived from the  word , ''bios'', "" and the suffix , ''-logia'', "study of."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin form of the term first appeared in 1736 when  (Carl von Linn&#233;) used ''biologi'' in his ''Bibliotheca botanica''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by Michael Christoph Hanov, a disciple of Christian Wolff. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was used in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg Roose used the term in a book, ''Grundz&#252;ge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft'', in the preface. Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Prop&#228;deutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802&#8211;22) by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre]. (1:4)
Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times.  was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of , , the , and . However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to .&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal study of  dates back to  (ca. 460 BC &#8211; ca. 370 BC), it was  (384 BC &#8211; 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his  and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the , , wrote a series of books on  that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the .
Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included  (781&#8211;869),  (828&#8211;896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name=Fahd-815&gt;, in &lt;/ref&gt; and  (865&#8211;925) who wrote on  and . Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.
Biology began to quickly develop and grow with 's improvement of the . It was then that scholars discovered , ,  and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by  led to new interest in  and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic  and .&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 133&#8211;144&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in  also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the . Then, in 1838,  and  began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of , although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of  and , however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as .&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 7; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapters 2&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians.  published a basic  for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced  for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; , treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable&#8212;even suggesting the possibility of . Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the ; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both  and .&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;
Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of , who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Gould 2002 187"&gt;, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell,  writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on ; similar reasoning and evidence led  to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: "Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent"; and chapter 11: "The causation of evolution: natural selection"; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was the subject of  (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.
The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and . In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to  as the component of  that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as . A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as  and , along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of . From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The  was cracked by ,  and  after DNA was understood to contain . Finally, the  was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human . This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.
Much of modern biology can be encompassed within five unifying principles: cell theory, evolution, genetics, homeostasis, and energy.&lt;ref name="avila_biology"/&gt;
 states that the  is the fundamental unit of , and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the  products of those cells (e.g. ). All cells arise from other cells through . In , every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized . The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the phenomenon of  occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as . Finally, cells contain hereditary information () which is passed from cell to cell during cell division.
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through , and that all life-forms known have a .

Retrieved on 2006-12-15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri&#8211;St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: "''The Origin of Species'' has special claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time&#8212;one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world... It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." &lt;/ref&gt; ( is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.
Darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of  and  or .&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859).

(For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see .)
The theory of evolution postulates that all s on the , both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral . This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the  as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all , , and s (see: ).&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A  is a unit of  and corresponds to a region of  that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into s. Cells  a DNA gene into an  version of the gene, and a  then  the RNA into a protein, a sequence of s. The  from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms, but slightly different for some.

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through . This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of  when sugar levels are too low.
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of . Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract  from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, s of s that constitute  play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological s; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.
The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or s. Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other s use solar energy via a process known as  to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as , whose bonds can be broken to release energy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A few , however, depend entirely on energy extracted by s from , , or other non- energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Edwards.

Some of the captured energy is used to produce  to sustain  and provide energy for growth and development. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and .&lt;ref name="Colvard, 2009"&gt;Bartsch/Colvard, ''The Living Environment''.

 is the study of biology at a molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Molecular_biology Molecular Biology &#8211; Definition from biology-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with  and . Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.

This is done on both the  and  levels, for single-celled organisms such as  as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as s. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

&lt;/ref&gt; Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins, which in turn play a large role in influencing (though, in many instances, not completely determining) the final  of the organism. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of s. Within organisms, genetic information generally is carried in s, where it is represented in the  of particular  s.

Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into  and , but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular  is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of  cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of  to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.
Physiology studies how for example , , , , and  systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with  oriented disciplines such as  and .
 is concerned with the origin and descent of , as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular s such as , , , or , but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.
Evolutionary biology is partly based on , which uses the  record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as &lt;ref&gt; Population Genetics: A Concise Guide, Johns Hopkins Press, 1998. ISBN 0-8018-5755-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theory. In the 1980s,  re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the  through the study of .&lt;ref&gt;Vassiliki Betta Smocovitis Unifiying Biology: the evolutionary synthesis and evolutionary biology ISBN 0-691-03343-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are , , and .
Multiple  events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of  is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: ; a; ; ae; ia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the :  (originally Archaebacteria);  (originally Eubacteria);  (including s, , , and s)&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;
Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
; ; ; ; ; ; ; .
There is also a series of intracellular s that are "on the edge of life"&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of  activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions that define life. They are classified as , s, s, or .
The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The dominant classification system is called the . It includes ranks and . How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the  (ICBN), the  (ICZN), and the  (ICNB).
A merging draft, , was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed.

Physics is one of the oldest s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of .&lt;ref&gt;The earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000BCE, such as the ians, , and the , all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with , certain branches of , and , but during the  in the 17th century, the s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;'s 1620 '''' was critical in the .&lt;/ref&gt; Physics intersects with many  areas of research, such as  and , and the boundaries of physics are not . New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.
Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new  that arise from theoretical breakthroughs. For example, advances in the understanding of  or  led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as , s, s, and s; advances in  led to the development of ; and advances in  inspired the development of .

'''''' started with the works of  in  and  in , and continued in  pioneered by ,  and .
In many ways, physics stems from . From ' first attempt to characterize matter, to ' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the  of a crystalline , and Aristotle's book '''' (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as  until the late 18th century.
By the 19th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on  to give an adequate description of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt; See Chapter 1 for a discussion on the necessity of philosophy of science.&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method employs '''' as well as '''' reasoning and the use of  to measure the validity of a given theory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 14 "Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of  and , , and metaphysical outlooks such as ,  and .&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 15 "Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?" ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;
Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance , who championed ,&lt;ref&gt;See Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory, Dover Publications (New York, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; and , who wrote on .&lt;ref&gt;See "The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics" Ox Bow Press (1995) ISBN 1-881987-09-4. and "My View of the World" Ox Bow Press (1983) ISBN 0-918024-30-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical physicist  has been called a  by ,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose (1996), ''The Nature of Space and Time'' ISBN 0-691-05084-8 p.4 "I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself."&lt;/ref&gt; a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, ''The Road to Reality'' ISBN 0-679-45443-8&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking refers to himself as an "unashamed reductionist" and takes issue with Penrose's views.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of  mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than s and moving at much less than the . These theories continue to be areas of active research, and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as  was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by  (1642&#8211;1727).
These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include , ,  and , , and .

Acoustics, the study of , is often considered a branch of mechanics because sound is due to the motions of the particles of air or other medium through which s can travel and thus can be explained in terms of the laws of mechanics. Among the important modern branches of acoustics is , the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing. , the study of , is concerned not only with  but also with  and , which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light.  is a form of , the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy.  and  have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an  gives rise to a  and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current.  deals with s at rest,  with moving charges, and  with magnetic poles at rest.
Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on the very large or very small scale. For example,  and  studies matter on the smallest scale at which s can be identified. The  is on an even smaller scale, as it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in large s. On this scale, ordinary, commonsense notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.
The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics.  is concerned with the discrete, rather than continuous, nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level, and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The  is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a  that is in motion with respect to an observer; the  is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the  with accelerated motion and its connection with . Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.
While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of  accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions.  contributed the framework of , which replaced notions of  with  and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. , , and others introduced , a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later,  unified  and .  allowed for a dynamical, curved , with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of  are being developed.
Mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature, especially the laws of physics. This was noted and advocated by ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth." &#8211;  (1623), '''', as quoted by G. Toraldo Di Francia (1976), ''The Investigation of the Physical World'' ISBN 0-521-29925-X p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and .
Physics theories use mathematics&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain order and provide precise formulas,  or  solutions, quantitative results and predictions. Experiment results in physics are numerical measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like  have made  an active area of research.
 is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while math statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.
The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.&lt;ref&gt;The application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories." Definition from the ''Journal of Mathematical Physics''. http://jmp.aip.org/jmp/staff.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The problems in this field start with a "" and a "math description of a physical law". Every math statement used for solution has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.
Physics is a branch of , not .&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science, Science. 1917. Page 645&lt;/ref&gt; Physics is also called "the fundamental science" because the subject of study of all branches of  like chemistry, astronomy, geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics.&lt;ref name="Feynman lectures"/&gt; For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and  of matter (chemistry's focus on the atomic scale ). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass and charge.
Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.
 is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular . An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from  in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.
The approach is similar to that of . Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, people working on  might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.
Physics is used heavily in . For example, , a subfield of , is used in the building of s and other structures. The understanding and use of  results in better concert halls; similarly, the use of  creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic s, video games, and movies, and is often critical in  investigations.
With the  that the  of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in . For example, in the , one can reasonably model earth's , , and rate of , over . It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.
But there is also considerable  in the physicist's methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics, e.g. the fields of  and sociophysics.
Physicists use  to test the validity of a , using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from s and observations conducted to test it. Experiments and observations are collected and compared with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory, thus aiding in the determination or the validity/invalidity of the theory.
A  is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of a theory, like Newton's law of universal gravitation. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Theorists seek to develop s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new experiments.
Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called . Phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory.
Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy;  was unified this way.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the influence of  and  on .&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,&lt;ref&gt;Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the  of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some, including 's critique of 's formulation of . By the end of , the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.&lt;/ref&gt; such as , a , and s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.
al physics informs, and is informed by,  and . Experimental physicists involved in  design and perform experiments with equipment such as s and s, whereas those involved in  often work in industry, developing technologies such as  and s. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well-explored by theorists.&lt;ref&gt; p.157: "In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. They ... very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses. "&lt;/ref&gt;
Physics covers a wide range of , from s (such as quarks, neutrinos and electrons) to the largest  of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore physics is sometimes called the "".&lt;ref name="Feynman lectures"&gt;'''' Volume I. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3 See Chapter 3: "The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences" for a general discussion. For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be "reduced" to physics, see  and ).&lt;/ref&gt; Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to s, and then connect these causes together.
For example, the  observed that certain rocks () were attracted to one another by some invisible force. This effect was later called , and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. A little earlier than the Chinese, the  knew of other objects such as , that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century, and came to be called . Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force&#8212;. This process of "unifying" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the  are now considered to be two aspects of the . Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason () for why nature is as it is (see section '''' below for more information).
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into ; ; ; ;  and . Some physics departments also support research in .
Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly , and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as  (1879&#8211;1955) and  (1908&#8211;1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the , which was innovated at  by , was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for &lt;/ref&gt;
 is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter.&lt;ref name="Taylor2002"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is concerned with the "condensed"  that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong.&lt;ref name=Cohen2008&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The most familiar examples of condensed phases are  and s, which arise from the bonding and  between s.&lt;ref name="Moore2011"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; More exotic condensed phases include the &lt;ref name=Leggett1999&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; found in certain atomic systems at very low , the  phase exhibited by s in certain materials,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the ic and ic phases of s on .&lt;ref name="Mattis2006"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, condensed matter physics grew out of , which is now considered one of its main subfields.&lt;ref name=CMPatAPS&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''condensed matter physics'' was apparently coined by  when he renamed his research group&#8212;previously ''solid-state theory''&#8212;in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the Division of Solid State Physics of the  was renamed as the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.&lt;ref name=CMPatAPS /&gt; Condensed matter physics has a large overlap with , ,  and .&lt;ref name=Cohen2008 /&gt;

The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of the  scales that are relevant. All three areas include both , semi-classical and  treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions, low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics.

The field is also called "high-energy physics" because many elementary particles do not occur naturally, but are created only during high-energy s of other particles.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and  are described by the .&lt;ref name="Oerter2006"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter (s and s) that interact via the , , and  s.&lt;ref name="Oerter2006" /&gt; Dynamics are described in terms of matter particles exchanging s (s, , and s, respectively).&lt;ref name="Gribbin1998"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Model also predicts a particle known as the ,&lt;ref name="Oerter2006" /&gt; the existence of which has not yet been verified. In July 2012 , the European laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.
The discovery by  in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of . Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for , , , and .
 is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, 's discovery that the universe was expanding, as shown by the , prompted rival explanations known as the  universe and the .
The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of  and the discovery of the  in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the . Cosmologists have recently established the  of the evolution of the universe, which includes ,  and .

Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.
In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of . Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable  and s.
In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the  have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that s have non-zero . These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing , and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. s have begun probing energy scales in the  range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the  and .&lt;ref&gt;584 co-authors "Direct observation of the strange 'b' baryon &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;" Fermilab-Pub-07/196-E, 12 June 2007 http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1690v2 finds a mass of 5.774 GeV for the &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many  and  phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the existence of , the , the  and the .
Although much progress has been made in high-energy, , and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving , , or  are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling , the shape of water s, mechanisms of  , and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.
These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern  methods and , which enabled  to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly  research, as exemplified by the study of  in  and the observation of  in  systems. In 1932,  said:&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law''' is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition,&lt;ref&gt;. Introduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; but one definition is that law is a  of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws are made by , specifically by their . The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a  (written or unwritten) and the  encoded therein.

A general distinction can be made between  s (including  and ), in which the legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and  systems, where judge-made  s are accepted. Historically, s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case in some countries, particularly Islamic.
The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas.  deals with conduct that is considered harmful to  and in which the  party may be imprisoned or fined.  (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of  (disputes) between individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a  (often monetary ) to the winning .
Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist:  regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on .  regulates the transfer and title of  and .  applies to assets held for investment and financial security.  allows claims for compensation if a person's property is .  provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives.  is used to review the decisions of government agencies.  governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging from trade to military action.
To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public servants, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent  and a vibrant  inform and support their progress.
Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into , ,  and . Law also raises important and complex issues concerning , , and . "In its majestic equality", said the author  in 1894, "the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread."&lt;ref&gt;The original French is: "La loi, dans un grand souci d'&#233;galit&#233;, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain" (France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 350 BC, the  philosopher  declared, "The  is better than the ."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle.

All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "" (a term related closely to the , and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "" (which covers contract,  and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1&#8211;2).&lt;/ref&gt; In  systems, contract and tort fall under a general , while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or .

Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the  as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900&#8211;901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court], 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Most jurisdictions, like the  and , have a single codified constitution with a . A few, like the , have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the , from ,  and . A case named ''''&lt;ref&gt;'''' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the , was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, , stated that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by , holds that , and the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can apply for  of actions or decisions by local councils, public services or government ministries, to ensure that they comply with the law. The first specialist administrative court was the '''' set up in 1799, as  assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;'s seminal treatise of 1763&#8211;1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' ('''').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevents people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of .&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, , that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or '''' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about '''', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite  to do a criminal act, or '''' (guilty mind). However for so called "" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260&#8211;261 about '''', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;D&#246;rmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsst&#246;rungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in , or pleading . Another example is in the 19th century English case of '''', which tested a defence of "". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from  to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17 year old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. , expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to , but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the  commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC], see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212&#8211;217, 229&#8211;237&lt;/ref&gt;
Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for  or ) v ..."

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase '''' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: ,  and the intention to create legal relations. In '''' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get 100. Many people sued for their &#163;100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an , mere puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a  Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good consideration for it by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said , "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]'' , and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142&#8211;143&lt;/ref&gt;
"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of  or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;'''' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. In Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html &#167; 311 Abs. II] &lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills".  has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html &#167; 105 Abs. II] &lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car.  law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;
Torts, sometimes called s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of , the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for his injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;'''' (). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of  (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a caf&#233; in . Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The  decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness.  took a distinctly moral approach, and said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the 's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;'''' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This became the basis for the four principles of negligence; (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a  to provide safe drinks (2) he  his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred  his breach and (4) his act was the , or not too  a consequence, of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;'''' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a  claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as ,  or . A better known tort is , which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, '''' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of  in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;'''' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, ; c.f. in the U.S., &lt;/ref&gt;
 law governs ownership and possession. , sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. '''' [1997] [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; , refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as . A right '''' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right '''' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns , , , s, s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, ,  and . An example of a basic case of most property law is '''' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;'''' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A 's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three  and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him.  ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keeper") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of '''' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.
This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251&#8211;274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by , is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [http://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and  with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, '''', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;
Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges. The  on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through  than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. '''' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of '''' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;'''' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the  on a  in , London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of . The , , agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous , typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or . A third type of legal system&#8212;accepted by some countries without &#8212;is religious law, based on s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The  that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.
Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation&#8212;especially s in constitutions or s passed by government&#8212;and .&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the  ''''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century  whose texts were rediscovered by late  Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the  and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay , ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529&#8211;534 AD the  Emperor  codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the . Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the  and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the  used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from s such as , continued to spread throughout Europe until the ; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the '''', and Germany, with the '''', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the  and  legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253&#8211;263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirg&#252;&#231;-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from  and  to most of  and .&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&#8211; Field Listing&#8211; Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; The United States follows the common law system described below.
Common law and equity are legal systems where decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged to be legal sources. The "doctrine of precedent", or '''' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts. Common law systems also rely on statutes, passed by the legislature, but may make less of a systematic attempt to codify their laws than in a "civil law" system. Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the  (except Malta, , the U.S. state of , and the Canadian province of ). In medieval England, the  led to a unification of various tribal customs and hence a law "common" to the whole country. The common law developed when the English monarchy had been weakened by the enormous cost of fighting for control over large parts of France.  had been forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or '''' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralised. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the  had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a rigid and inflexible system of common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the  gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of , the first  to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own . At first, equity was often criticised as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of '' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; But over time it developed solid , especially under .&lt;ref&gt;'''' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the two systems were fused into one another. In developing the common law and equity, academic authors have always played an important part. , from around 1760, was the first scholar to describe and teach it.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&#8211; Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish  and Islamic &#8212;both of which translate as the "path to follow"&#8212;while Christian  also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments. However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the  has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; '''' (reasoning by analogy), '''' (consensus) and . This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as  and  respectively. Another example is the  or , in the  or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The  is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless,  allows s to use religious laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic Church, the  and the .
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the  in a non-codified form, with the 's  code in the 19th century being first attempt at  elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274&#8211;275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157&#8211;158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name = Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia], Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of  has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected .&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of law is closely connected to the development of . ian law, dating as far back as 3000BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of , characterised by tradition, al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd centuryBC, the ancient ian ruler  had formulated the first , which consisted of  statements ("if ... then ..."). Around 1760BC,  further developed , by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as , for the entire public to see; this became known as the . The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully  and translated into various languages, including English, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;
The  dates back to 1280BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small  city-state, ancient , from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the  class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5&#8211;6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''th&#233;mis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''d&#237;k&#275;'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P.

It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104&#8211;107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by  and  during the , Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin s (called ) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of  which later became the . A Europe-wide  was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The  and  Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the .
Ancient  and  represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The '''', probably compiled around 100AD (although it contains older material), and the '''' (c.100&#8211;300AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18&#8211;25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and , and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This  tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the .&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei,  and  also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the , but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19thcentury. Similarly,  gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the  in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today  retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between 's nationalists, who fled there, and 's communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by  , which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights.

The philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence is essentially , and asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" 's  answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; yers on the other side, such as , argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient  concurrently and in entanglement with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of  through the writings of .
, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse&#8212;as Aristotle had indicated&#8212;and reason.&lt;ref&gt;, ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115&#8211;116&lt;/ref&gt;  believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;, ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt;  and his student Austin, following , believed that this conflated the  problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's ; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by , who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the , and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97&#8211;98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23&#8211;26&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1934, the Austrian philosopher  continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity"; meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' &#8364;500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm ('''') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, , rejected both positivism and the idea of the  because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref name="&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25&#8211;26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception (), which denied that legal norms could encompass of all political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170&#8211;171&lt;/ref&gt;
Later in the 20th century,  attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''Law's Empire'',  attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an " concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. , on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3&#8211;36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to , rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 18th century  presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S.  law. The most influential proponents, such as  and  and the so-called  of economists and lawyers including  and , are generally advocates of  and , and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;
The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991  winner , whose first major article, '''' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386&#8211;405&lt;/ref&gt;  trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, '''' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would  with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1&#8211;44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a  case named '''', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges"/&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of  may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most  solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as .&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of , ,  and  are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called  studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as . At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, , who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;
Around 1900  defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary"/&gt; Another leading sociologist, , wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included , ,  and  in Europe, and  in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81&#8211;82&lt;/ref&gt;
The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent , representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police,  organisation, the  and  itself. John Locke, in his '''', and  in '''', advocated for a  between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;, ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6&#8211;7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the , in contrast to the  theory of ' ''''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;
 and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to , whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this is the ;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the ; in the UK, the ;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''''; in France, the ''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts], Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the  member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1&#8211;2&lt;/ref&gt;
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be . For example, in '''', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established  schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the  to the .&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;
A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only  the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the . The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of , whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37&#8211;82&lt;/ref&gt;
In s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen&#8211;Heller, ''Introduction'', 11&#8211;12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282&#8211;284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the  may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the  ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115&#8211;116&lt;/ref&gt;
Prominent examples of legislatures are the  in London, the  in Washington D.C., the  in Berlin, the  in Moscow, the  in Rome and the  in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are , most countries are , meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller . The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a  system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a . One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101"/&gt;
To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must  for a  in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart&#8211;Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The executive in a legal system serves as a government's centre of political . In a , as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is chosen by the Prime Minister or , whose office holds power under the  of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;
The  is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the  (appointed by members of federal and state Parliaments) the  (a  title), and the  (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the , found in France, the U.S. and Russia. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for , the military and police, and the bureaucracy.  or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a  or . The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.
While military organizations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, 's system of traveling s, or , used s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of ,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces], History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix &#224; la Police de Proximit&#233;], La Pr&#233;fecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;
 famously argued that the state is that which controls the .&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term  refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166&#8211;167).&lt;/ref&gt;
The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the  for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by , a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to  motivated by .&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;
Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, management is composed of career experts, who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;
A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to be able to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of an  in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary&#8212;in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor (solicitor).&lt;ref&gt;Hazard&#8211;Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;'''' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to maintain professionalism, the  is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a ,  or . Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a , a  or a  &lt;ref&gt;Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a , a  or a .&lt;/ref&gt;), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment (). Most Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law]&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally-trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard&#8211;Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&#8211;23&lt;/ref&gt;
Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a , in a  as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal . In addition a lawyer may become a er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or through freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;
Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring , s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court s, persuasive , contracts, or  and trusts. Negotiation and  skills (including  techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364"/&gt;
 concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3&#8211;4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, '''', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher  distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''burgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277&#8211;278&lt;/ref&gt;
Hegel believed that  and the  were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state&#8211;civil society was reproduced in the theories of  and .&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1&#8211;13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5&#8211;9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author  wrote of international law,
&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98&#8211;99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
,  and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a  is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and  the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, , non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the ) exclude the political parties.

A focus of the subject is how  behave or interact and how  work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics.  examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions.  analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.
Other broad distinctions include those between  (describing "what is") and  (advocating "what ought to be"); between economic theory and ; between  and ; and between  (more "orthodox" and dealing with the "rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus") and  (more "radical" and dealing with the "institutions-history-social structure nexus").&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Caplin and Andrew Schotter, ''The Foundations of Positive and Normative Economics'', Oxford University Press, 2008, ISBN 0-19-532831-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, John B.

 provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook '''' (1890) that extends analysis beyond  and from the  to the  level:
:Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred (1890 [1920]).

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behavior and  modeling  of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields.&lt;ref name="Backhouse2009Stigler"&gt;&#8226; Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven G.

(1976). ''The Economic Approach to Human Behavior'', Chicago, [http://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PA5=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt; One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the "choice process and the type of  that [such] analysis involves." The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven Medema (2009). "Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics", ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 23(1), p. 229, Introduction, and Conclusion [pp. [http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.23.1.221 221&#8211;33].&lt;/ref&gt;
 refers to not only increase in the output and growth of an economy but includes the various changes in the institutional arrangements through which output is generated. Economic Development refers to the achievement of a new equilibrium over the previously attained .  It is a micro economic concept with direct relation to Economic  as Growth can be achieved with or without development but Economic Development always results in growth.
Microeconomics is the study of economics analysing individual players of a market and the  of such markets. It deals with, as its irreducible base unit, private, public and domestic players. Microeconomics studies how these players interact with each other through individual markets (assuming that there is a scarcity of tradable units and . A  might deal with a ''product'' (such as apples, aluminium and mobile phones), or with ''services of a '', (brick laying, book printing, food packaging). Microeconomics theory considers the  (the sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers, studying each possible price per unit (i.e. supply and demand). It studies the complex interaction between market players both through buying and selling. Theory holds that markets may reach  between "quantity demanded" and "quantity supplied" (supply and demand) over time.
Microeconomics also examines various market structures.  describes a market structure such that no participants are large enough to have the  to set the price of a homogeneous product. Another way of putting this is to say a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a "price taker", and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells.  refers to market structures where the conditions of perfect competition do not exist. Forms of imperfect competition include:  (in which there is only one seller of a good),  (in which there are only two sellers of a good),  (in which there are few sellers of a good),  (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods),  (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and  (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.
Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as  analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market.  theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;&#8226;  (2007).

In microeconomics,  is the conversion of  into . It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a  for  or direct use. Production is a  and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for  (food, haircuts, etc.) vs.  (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), s (national defense, small-pox vaccinations, etc.) or s (new computers, bananas, etc.), and .
 refers to the  of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet  actions. It has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between  and .".&lt;ref&gt; (1987). "opportunity cost", '''', v. 3, pp. 718&#8211;21.&lt;/ref&gt; The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the  of , , or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ().&lt;ref&gt;'', Economics A-Z, ''[http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST "Opportunity Cost."] Accessed 3 Aug. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Inputs used in the production process include such primary  as ,  (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and  (including natural resources). Other inputs may include s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.
 describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available . Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of "waste" is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is , which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.
 The  (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an  can produce just two goods (say "guns" and "butter"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows  for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.
 is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Guido (1987), "scarcity", , v. 4, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an . This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter. The  of the curve at a point on it gives the  between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a , movement along the curve may indicate that the  of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.
By construction, each point on the curve shows '''' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high  during a   or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy  (also called ) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.
Much  in  is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the "essence of economics", where the subject "makes its unique contribution."&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and  considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in  of  per worker or / ratios. According to theory, this may give a  in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input. Even if one region has an  as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.
It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of  and  to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.&lt;ref&gt; (1980).

An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.
Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market s of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively)  inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a  or by .&lt;ref&gt; (1993, 2nd ed.).

 have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a  economy.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, A. (1987). "prices and quantities", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In , it applies to price and output determination for a market with , which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting .
For a given market of a , ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure).  describes individual consumers as  choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is "constrained utility maximization" (with income and  as the  on demand). Here,  refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.
The  states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy of it (other things ). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the ). In addition,  from the price decline increases ability to buy (the ). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a  outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.
''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit-maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a directly proportional relation between price and quantity supplied (other things unchanged). That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The "Law of Supply" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.
 occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The  of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.
For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or , to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit.&lt;ref&gt; (2007). "Economic Theory", Measurement and ordinal utility, ''The New Encyclop&#230;dia Britannica'', v. 17, p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding point on the supply curve measures , the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a , supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) ''variable'' in the , which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively ''fixed'', such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the , all inputs may be adjusted by . These distinctions translate to differences in the  (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.
, such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to  and  constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares  (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the  of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change "at the margin": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.
Other applications of demand and supply include the  among the , including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive  for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the  (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers).  examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, , and (un)employment, productivity through , and related public-policy issues.&lt;ref&gt; (1987).

People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through ''firms''. The most obvious kinds of firms are s,  and . According to  people begin to organise their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, '''' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater  (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

The term "" encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorise market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.&lt;ref&gt;&#8226; Cf.  (2004), whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions, which are (1) producers as price takers (i.e. presence of oligopoly or monopoly; but why is this not a product of the following?) (2) equal power of consumers (what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power) (3) complete markets (4) public goods (5) external effects (i.e. externalities?) (6) increasing returns to scale (i.e. practical monopoly) (7) perfect information [in his ''Economics of the Welfare State'', 4th ed., Oxford University Press, pp. 72&#8211;79].&lt;br/&gt; &#8226;  (2000) classifies market failures as from failure of competition (including ), , , ,  situations, and  disturbances (in his ''Economics of the Public Sector'', 3rd ed., Ch.4, W.W.

, or the overlapping concepts of "practical" and "technical" monopoly, is an extreme case of ''failure of competition'' as a restraint on producers. The problem is described as one where the more of a product is made, the lower the unit costs are. This means it only makes economic sense to have one producer.

 occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price  caused by these externalities.&lt;ref&gt; (1987).

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the "long run" may be very long.
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or  by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labor force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes. Classical unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (2008). http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000311.&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt; While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates.  represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 445-446.&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Christopher J.

 is a ''means of final payment'' for goods in most  economies and the  in which prices are typically stated. A very apt statement by Professor Walker, a well-known economist is that, " Money is what money does." Money has a general acceptability, a relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elastic in supply and survives with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others.
As a , money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with  (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate  as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the  of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.&lt;ref&gt; (1992).

Governments implement fiscal policy by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an  where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government. For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have  where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity. 
The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by . When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed. Skeptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of . They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from fiscal policy will be offset by the increased savings rate intended to pay for future higher taxes.

Mainstream economic theory relies upon  quantitative , which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of '''', which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration. When creating theories, the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories.&lt;ref&gt; (1953).

Both groups were associated with the rise of  and  in Europe.  was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;&#8226; NA (2007).

, a group of 18th century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a  of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of , which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;NA (2007).

The   (1798) used the idea of diminishing returns to explain low living standards. , he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;[Malthus, Thomas] (1798). ''.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Malthus also questioned the automatic tendency of a  to produce full employment. He blamed unemployment upon the economy's tendency to limit its spending by saving too much, a theme that lay forgotten until  revived it in the 1930s.
While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income,  (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of , according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower ''relative'' cost of production, rather relying only on its own production.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, 1817.

Coming at the end of the Classical tradition,  (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1848, 1871, 7th ed.). ''''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the "real price of every thing... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it" as influenced by its scarcity. Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam (1776). [http://www.bartleby.com/10/105.html/ The Wealth of Nations], Bk. 1, Ch. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the ''. Classical economics focused on the tendency of markets to move to long-run equilibrium.
Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics. It derives from the work of . The first volume of Marx's major work, '''', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the  and the  which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;&#8226;  (1987). "Marxian value analysis". ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, 383.&lt;br/&gt; &#8226;  (1987). "Marx, Karl Heinrich", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economicsv. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.
A body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as  as a concise synonym for 'economic science' and a substitute for the earlier "".&lt;ref name="MarshallJevons" /&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Barry (1998). ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'', Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neoclassical economics systematized  as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the  inherited from classical economics in favor of a  theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). "marginalist economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favor of , which hypothesizes merely behavior-based relations across persons.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Black (1987 [2008])). "utility", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt;
In , neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping . An immediate example of this is the  of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt; In  it is reflected in an early and lasting  with Keynesian macroeconomics.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; (1937).

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as ''orthodox economics'' whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern  builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as , , analysis of  and , and the  of  for analyzing long-run variables affecting .
Keynesian economics derives from , in particular his book '''' (1936), which ushered in contemporary  as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;&#8226; &lt;br/&gt; &#8226; Blaug, Mark (2007). "The Social Sciences: Economics", ''The New Encyclop&#230;dia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 347. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low "" and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. Such terms as "revolutionary" have been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;&#8226; Tarshis, L. (1987). "Keynesian Revolution", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 47&#8211;50.&lt;br/&gt; &#8226; Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004).

Keynesian economics has two successors.  also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the  and the work of .&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, G.C.(1987). "Post-Keynesian Economics", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 47&#8211;50.&lt;/ref&gt;
 is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behavior but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.
The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and  ideas. According to  and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. , current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by  and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of The New York Times Magazine, where he claims that the social responsibility of business should be "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton. "The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits."

"" is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the  historian  in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname "the dismal science" as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend , who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with  on , in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it.&lt;ref name="Dismal"/&gt;
Some economists, like  or , have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution.

In ''The Wealth of Nations'',  addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smith's day, these were referred to as , but are now more commonly called , a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright , ,  and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;See Noam Chomsky (''Understanding Power''), [http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm#f1] on Smith's emphasis on class conflict in the Wealth of Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy.

Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on  research,  pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use "informal models" based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were "trotted out ''''". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behavior, was neglected.&lt;ref&gt;

'''History''' (from   - ''historia'', meaning "inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation"&lt;ref name=JosephJanda/&gt;) is an  that relates to past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of  about these events. The term includes , , and , but is often generically implied to mean . Scholars who write about history are called s.
History can also refer to the  which uses a  to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.&lt;ref name="evans1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Historians sometimes debate the  and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on the problems of the present.&lt;ref name="evans1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tosh1&gt;p 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding ) are usually classified as  or s, because they do not support the "disinterested investigation" required of the discipline of history.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Low1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Events occurring prior to written record are considered .
, a 5th century B.C.  is considered within the Western tradition to be the "father of history", and, along with his contemporary , helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In the Eastern tradition, a state chronicle the  was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.
Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a  in University studies.
A derivation from ''*weid-'' "know" or "see" is attested as "the reconstructed etymon ''wid-tor'' ["one who knows"] (compare to English ''wit'') a suffixed zero-grade form of the  root ''*weid-'' 'see' and so is related to Greek ''eid&#233;nai'', to know".&lt;ref name=JosephJanda&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="etym"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (''h&#237;st&#333;r'') means "inquiry","knowledge from inquiry", or  "judge". It was in that sense that  used the word in his &lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora"&gt;Ferrater-Mora, Jos&#233;. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Per&#236; T&#224; Z&#244;a &#919;istor&#237;ai'' "Inquiries about Animals"). The ancestor word  is attested early on in , , the  ' oath, and in  inscriptions (in a legal sense, either "judge" or "witness", or similar).
The word entered the  in 1390 with the meaning of "relation of incidents, story". In , the meaning was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning "record of past events" arises in the late 15th century. It was still in the Greek sense that  used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about "". For him, ''historia'' was "the knowledge of objects determined by space and time", that sort of knowledge provided by  (while  was provided by , and  was provided by ).
In an expression of the linguistic , English like Chinese (&#21490; vs. &#35788;) now designates separate words for human history and  in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both "history" and "story".
The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Historian'' in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531. In all , the substantive "history" is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, "History", or the word ''''.&lt;ref name="Ferrater-Mora" /&gt;
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of , "All history is contemporary history". History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;Whitney, W. D. (1889). [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. New York: The Century Co. Page [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search &#8211; 3.0], "History".&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').
The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the  and at other times as part of the .&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. ISBN 0-415-05682-9&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French   revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as , , and  in the study of global history.
Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an , and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. For the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995).The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. ISBN 0-415-12346-1&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
 is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not "fill the gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, Historical Archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical , USA has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of "liberty" inherent in written documents at this time.
There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, , territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in "The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830&#8211;1975." It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called  resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or  aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The  is the memory of the past  of '''' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of  and  America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the .&lt;ref&gt; (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from )&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian  wrote:
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as  and New Zealand  in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of  and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the . As a  analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, , , use of , or method of presentation of other s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.

Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development&#8212;that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the , which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

However, his contemporary  (ca. 460 BC &#8211; ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the . Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as , with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p6"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval . The groundwork for professional historiography in  was established by the  court historian known as  (145&#8211;90 BC), author of the '''' ().

In the preface to his book, the '''' (1377), the  and , , warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle  and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a  to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;, Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, , ISBN 0-691-01754-9.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of , ,  and  in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H.

"The Islamic Concept of Knowledge", ''Al-Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought &amp; Culture'' '''12''' (3).&lt;/ref&gt;
In the West historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was  in Germany.
In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or , to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a  rather than as an , which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included , , , , , , , , , ,  and . Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of  has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.
In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as , , ,  and  argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the , and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the  introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of  (cf. ''''). Intellectual historians such as ,  and  have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of  to emerge in the post-WWII era was '''' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as ,  and  sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the  period.
 such as , , , , , , , , ,  and  have sought to validate 's theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as , , , ,  and  have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history.  historians such as , , , , , , , and  have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years,  have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', , a professor of modern history at , defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian 's 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these  names in order to allow "organising ideas and classificatory generalisations" to be used by historians.&lt;ref name="Marwick-p169"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period.  and s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the  used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name="Tosh-p168-169"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Particular  locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, s,  and . Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to . Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the  is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by  and , among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The "old" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with ,  and the history of . English historian  saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural history replaced  as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of  as well is the study of images and human visual production .&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionnary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), "Dictionnaire mondial des images", Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, ISBN : 978-2-84736-185-8.

This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of  between states or across state boundaries over time. This is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be.
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, "Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?," Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [http://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;
World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field.  It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie T. Embree and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, "World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,"''Chinese Studies in History,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.
The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html JWH Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~world/ H-World]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.
A  is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the . A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the , the , the , the , and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.
 is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts.
 is a sub-field of History and , which looks at the past from the perspective of . It is in many ways, an outgrowth of . Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.
 describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.
Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In , historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the "judgement of history."&lt;ref name="Curran2000p413"&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.

'''' is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard  in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive , works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority.  In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching  or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, "Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York," ''History Teacher,'' (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;
At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.
The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the  as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers p&#233;dagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation p&#233;dagogique, (INRDP).  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians&#8217; approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis Fran&#231;ois, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote "active methods" which would give pupils "the immense happiness of discovery." Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, " The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s," ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;
In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the  has been removed from textbooks and the entire World War II is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, "The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective," ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;"Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History," ''Russian Studies in History,'' Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
According to sociologist , in the United States the history of the  some places has been phrased to avoid giving offense to white Southerners&lt;ref&gt;James W. Loewen, '''', (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and blacks.
Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;"Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India," ''History Workshop Journal,'' April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, "Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR," ''History Teacher,'' February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;
In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an "almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone" and reflects "principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace."  The result is that "German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."&lt;ref&gt;Simone L&#228;ssig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, "History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany," ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education''' in its general sense is a form of  in which , , and  of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through teaching, training, research, or simply through .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, it occurs through any  that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts.
, the word "education" is derived from the Latin '''' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from '''' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the  '''' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from '''' ("from, out of") and '' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

A right to education has been created and recognized by some jurisdictions: Since 1952, Article 2 of the first Protocol to the  obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level, the '  of 1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout history various governments have made it illegal to educate children  or at home. Various s, for example, have mandated indoctrination through propaganda in the  and .
Systems of schooling involve institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum, which itself is established according to a predetermined purpose of the schools in the system. Schools systems are sometimes also based on religions, giving them different curricula.
In formal education, a  is the set of courses and their content offered at a  or . As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the  word for '''', referring to the course of  and experiences through which ren grow to become mature s. A curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general  which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.
An  is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university&#8211;or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the s, , , s,  and s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Educational institutions may incorporate  as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml Education World: Fine Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;
The term preschool refers to a school for children who are not old enough to attend kindergarten. It is a nursery school.
Preschool education is important because it can give a child the edge in a competitive world and education climate. While children who do not receive the fundamentals during their preschool years will be taught the alphabet, counting, shapes and colors and designs when they begin their formal education they will be behind the children who already possess that . The true purpose behind kindergarten is "to provide a child-centered, preschool curriculum for three to seven year old children that aimed at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5&#8211;7years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of primary-age children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the  programs driven by , most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education. The division between primary and  is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools''. Primary schools in these countries are often subdivided into s and .
In India, compulsory education spans over twelve years, out of which children receive elementary education for 8 years. Elementary schooling consists of five years of primary schooling and 3 years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on national curriculum framework designed by the .
In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during . It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive  for s, to the optional, selective , "post-secondary", or "" education (e.g. , vocational school) for s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or s, s, s, middle schools, s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and  primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as  education, and in New Zealand Year 1&#8211;13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give , to prepare for  or to train directly in a .
The emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until 1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required s. In order to meet this new job demand, s were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for  or skilled  work. This proved to be beneficial for both employers and employees, for the improvement in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just primary educational attainment.
In Europe, grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of , s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves have an even longer history.
Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related to but different from . In a sense, autodidacticism is "learning on your own" or "by yourself", and an autodidact is a self-teacher. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorbing process. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas.  include  (U.S. president),  (mathematician),  (chemist and physicist),  (naturalist),  (inventor),  (architect),  (playwright),  (composer, recording engineer, film director),and  (engineer, scientist, mathematician).
 is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an  or  as well as institutions teaching courses such as , , , ,  and .
 refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
An anarchistic free school (also anarchist free school and free school) is a decentralized network in which skills, information, and knowledge are shared without hierarchy or the institutional environment of formal schooling. Free school students may be adults, children, or both. This organisational structure is distinct from ones used by democratic free schools which permit children's individual initiatives and learning endeavors within the context of a school democracy, and from free education where 'traditional' schooling is made available to pupils without charge. The open structure of free schools is intended to encourage self-reliance, critical consciousness, and personal development. Free schools often operate outside the  in favor of a . Nevertheless, the meaning of the "free" of free schools is not restricted to monetary cost, and can refer to an emphasis on free speech and student-centred education.
, also known as ''non-traditional education'' or ''educational alternative'', is a broad term that may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of  (for all age groups and levels of education). This may include not only forms of education designed for students with special needs (ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability), but also forms of education designed for a general audience and employing alternative educational philosophies and methods.
Alternatives of the latter type are often the result of  and are rooted in various  that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional . While some have strong , , or  orientations, others are more informal associations of teachers and s dissatisfied with certain aspects of . These alternatives, which include s, s, s,  and  vary, but often emphasize the value of small class size, close relationships between students and teachers, and a .
Alternative education may also allow for independent learning and engaging class activities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were often educated by physicians or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like , , , ) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  Special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities in its early years, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of education through recreation was first applied to childhood development in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Educationalist Lawrence , who was also an early proponent of lifelong learning, best described the modern concept of education through recreation in the following quotation "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."(Jacks, 1932).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165&#8211;170"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the  to teach  to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165&#8211;170"/&gt;
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or . Tertiary education is normally taken to include  and , as well as . Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt of , s, or s.
Higher education generally involves work towards a degree-level or  qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national , both as a significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.
University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the ''undergraduate'' level (sometimes referred to as ) and the '''' (or ''postgraduate'') level (sometimes referred to as ). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent, like , they can be public and State governed, like the , or they can be independent but State funded, like the .
Higher education in particular is currently undergoing a transition towards ,  alone is currently growing at 14 times the rate of traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. Open education is generally significantly cheaper than traditional campus based learning and in many cases even free. Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form  Other universities offering open education are Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington, Caltech. It has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many people despite favorable studies on effectiveness may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The conventional merit system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities. Although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the  in the . Currently many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.
There has been a culture forming around distance learning for people who are looking to enjoy the shared social aspects that many people value in traditional on campus education that is not often directly offered from open education. Examples of this are people in open education forming ,  and movements such as .
A  institution can be defined as a " or   aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, , or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as the liberal arts college began in ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the term is more commonly associated with Universities in the .
A nonresidential junior college offering courses to people living in a particular area.
One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Also technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as  (a type of ). This gives students the opportunity to choose what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including , and provides new ways to engage students, such as s.
One such tool are , which are an "interactive, Web-based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge" (Moyer, Bolyard, &amp; Spikell, 2002). In short, virtual manipulatives are dynamic visual/pictorial replicas of physical mathematical manipulatives, which have long been used to demonstrate and teach various mathematical concepts. Virtual manipulatives can be easily accessed on the Internet as stand-alone applets, allowing for easy access and use in a variety of educational settings. Emerging research into the effectiveness of virtual manipulatives as a teaching tool have yielded promising results, suggesting comparable, and in many cases superior overall concept-teaching effectiveness compared to standard teaching methods.
Technology is being used more not only in administrative duties in education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such as  and  is capturing the attention of students in the classroom. Technology is also being used in the assessment of students. One example is the  (ARS), which allows immediate feedback tests and classroom discussions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a "diverse set of tools and resources used to communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage information."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies include computers, the Internet, broadcasting technologies (radio and television), and telephony. There is increasing interest in how computers and the Internet can improve education at all levels, in both formal and non-formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Older ICT technologies, such as radio and television, have for over forty years been used for open and distance learning, although print remains the cheapest, most accessible and therefore most dominant delivery mechanism in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to classroom application and growth of e-learning opportunities for knowledge attainment, educators involved in student affairs programming have recognized the increasing importance of computer usage with data generation for and about students. Motivation and retention counselors, along with faculty and administrators, can impact the potential academic success of students by provision of technology based experiences in the University setting.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard (1989) Student Affairs-The Future.Journal of College Student Development, v30 n1 p86&#8211;89.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of computers and the Internet is in its infancy in developing countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and the attendant high costs of access. Usually, various technologies are used in combination rather than as the sole delivery mechanism. For example, the Kothmale Community Radio Internet uses both radio broadcasts and computer and Internet technologies to facilitate the sharing of information and provide educational opportunities in a rural community in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Open University of the United Kingdom (UKOU), established in 1969 as the first educational institution in the world wholly dedicated to open and distance learning, still relies heavily on print-based materials supplemented by radio, television and, in recent years, online programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk Open University of the United Kingdom] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India combines the use of print, recorded audio and video, broadcast radio and television, and audio conferencing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignou.ac.in Indira Gandhi National Open University] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "computer-assisted learning" (CAL) has been increasingly used to describe the use of technology in teaching. Classrooms of the 21st century contain interactive white boards, , , laptops, etc.   sites are another tool teachers can implement into CAL curricula for students to understand communication and collaboration efforts of group work through electronic means. Teachers are encouraged to embed these technological devices and services in the curriculum in order to enhance students learning and meet the needs of various types of learners.
Adult learning, or adult education, is the practice of  and developing skills in adults. It is also sometimes referred to as  (the art and science of helping adults learn).Adult education has become common in many countries. It takes on many forms, ranging from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning and . A number of career specific courses such as  assisting, medical billing and coding, ,  and many more are now available to students through the .
With the boom of information from availability of knowledge through means of internet and other modern low cost information exchange mechanisms people are beginning to take an attitude of . To make knowledge and  a lifelong focus as opposed to the more traditional view that knowledge and in particular value creating trade skills are to be learned just exclusively in youth.
There has been work on learning styles over the last two decades. Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified individual talents or aptitudes in his  theories. Based on the works of , the  and &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; focused on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of  and 's Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.
It is currently fashionable to divide education into different learning "modes". The learning modalities&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt; are probably the most common:
* : learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* : learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* : learning based on hands-on work and engaging in activities.
Although it is claimed that, depending on their preferred learning modality, different teaching techniques have different levels of effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser,&lt;/ref&gt; recent research has argued "there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A consequence of this theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that  such as VAK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name="titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called s, and they direct the education of s and might draw on many  like , , ,  and . Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called s, instructors, or s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top]. mckinsey.com. September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 can refer to either a normative or a descriptive theory of education. In the first case, a theory means a postulation about what ought to be. It provides the "goals, norms, and standards for conducting the process of education."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the second case, it means "an hypothesis or set of hypotheses that have been verified by observation and experiment."&lt;ref name=Kneller93&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A descriptive theory of education can be thought of as a conceptual scheme that ties together various "otherwise discrete particulars... For example, a cultural theory of education shows how the concept of culture can be used to organize and unify the variety of facts about how and what people learn."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, for example, there is the  that comes from  and the  that comes from .&lt;ref name=Webb&gt;Webb, DL, A Metha, and KF Jordan (2010).

It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries.

Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "".

At the individual level, there is a large literature, generally related back to the work of ,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital of the individual. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds).

Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307&#8211;458.&lt;/ref&gt;
Economists  and Herbert Gintis famously argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the  goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production on the other.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of education according to Dieter Lenzen, president of the  1994, "began either millions of years ago or at the end of 1770". Education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. Adults trained the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next. Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially. When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., formal education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.
The first large established university is thought to be  established in 427 A.D in India.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  At its peak, the university attracted scholars and students from as far away as Tibet, China, Greece, and Persia. The first university establishments in the western world are thought to be  (founded in 1088) and later  (founded around 1096).

Greek civilization was subsumed within the . While the Roman Empire and its new Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the  centered at Constantinople in the East, Western civilization suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

He gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his  were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in the East into the modern era.
In Western Europe after the , the  emerged as the unifying force. Initially the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe, the church established  in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these ultimately evolved into  and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages,  operated the famous and influential .

As an academic field, philosophy of education is a "the philosophical study of education and its problems... its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of ".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of , drawing from fields of , ,  and the philosophical approaches (, prescriptive, and/or ) to address questions in and about , , and , as well as the process of , to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between  and practice.
 said, "Modern education means handing down the customs of the minority, and rooting out the customs of the majority."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals purposes for pursuing education can vary. However in early age the focus is generally around developing basic  and  skills in order to further ability to learn more complex skills and subjects. After acquiring these basic abilities education is commonly focused towards individuals gaining necessary knowledge and skills to improve ability to create value and a  for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/oochart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Satisfying personal curiosities (Education for the sake of itself) and desire for , to "better oneself" without career based reasons for doing so are also common reasons why people pursue education and use schools.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the  of s as s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as , whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as  children and those with specific .
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by , bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between  and . Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including , , curriculum development, ,  and . Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to  and the . In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).
The  is the study of how social institutions and forces affect educational processes and outcomes, and vice versa. By many, education is understood to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater equality and acquiring wealth and status for all (Sargent 1994). Learners may be motivated by aspirations for progress and betterment. Learners can also be motivated by their interest in the subject area or specific skill they are trying to learn. In fact, learner-responsibility education models are driven by the interest of the learner in the topic to be studied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

''Without capacity, there is no development''. Paris: UNESCO-IIPE [http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* they should embrace an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development, while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels.
* Removal of a certain percentage of students for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade)
Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and . There are charities dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials, for example, the  project.

Education is becoming increasingly international. The most represented case is the spread of mass schooling. Mass schooling has implanted the fundamental concepts that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of his/her cultural background and gender differences. The system has also promoted the global rules and norms of how the school should operate and what is education.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David P., and Gerald K. LeTendre.

Print&lt;/ref&gt; Though the system can have variations in local, regional, and country level, the similarities&#8212; in systems or even in ideas&#8212; that schools share also enable the exchange among students at all levels which are also playing an increasingly important role in globalization process. In Europe, for example, the Socrates- Program&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the  have contributed to the internationalization of education. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes. This facilitates the globalization of education.

'''War''' is an organised and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by  and/or . It is characterised by extreme ,  disruption, and economic destruction.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of  or .&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as '''warfare'''. An absence of war is usually called .
In 2003, Nobel Laureate  identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1832  '''', Prussian military general and theoretician  defined war as follows: "War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will."&lt;ref&gt; Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;
While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by  in his ''History of Warfare'', war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John, (1901) ''A History of Warfare'', (Pimlico)&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Societies at Peace (Howell and Willis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ever changing technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the one end lies the  of the  with its stones and clubs, and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons. Found at the other end of this continuum is , along with the recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of the complete .
The largest still ongoing conflict, in terms of cumulative number of deaths since start, is the , with 3&#8211;5 million deaths since 1998, nearly invisible in non-African media.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Hawkins, [http://books.google.se/books?id=C98wjmRllAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Virgil+Hawkins+%E2%80%9DStealth+conflicts&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YrIDUZW9MKfA0QX_wYGgBQ&amp;redir_esc=y  Stealth Conflicts: How the World's Worst Violence Is Ignored], Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the largest ongoing conflict in terms of deaths is the  and the .
The English word ''war'' derives from the late  (c.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre''; the  ''werre''; the  ''werra''; and the  ''werso''. The denotation of ''war'' derives from the  ''werran'',  ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'': &#8220;to confuse&#8221;, &#8220;to perplex&#8221;, and &#8220;to bring into confusion&#8221;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited derivation is from the  ''barbaros'', the  ''varhara'', and the Sanskrit ''varvar'' and ''barbara''. In German, the equivalent is ''Krieg''; the equivalent Spanish, , and Italian words for "war" is ''guerra'', derived from the Germanic ''werra'' (&#8220;fight&#8221;, &#8220;tumult&#8221;).&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Lengua Espa&#241;ola'', 21&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; edici&#243;n (1992) p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for "war", to avoid using the  ''bellum'', because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word ''bello'' ("beautiful")
Before the dawn of civilization, war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a n cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.&lt;ref name="Keeley"&gt;Keeley: ''War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage''&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the  some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of  and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, "One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In '''', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the , says that approximately 90&#8211;95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were perpetrated by primitive societies. A finding that has been supported by more recent research looking at violence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. P&#233;rez, eds. 2012. The Bioarchaeology of Violence. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the massacre by pre-state societies can be exhibited by the  tribes of the subarctic in North America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing 4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Keeley"/&gt; This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never recovered. Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate societies. The protection provided by defensive structures could not justify the valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it.&lt;ref name="Keeley"/&gt;
 wrote that "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [ie, after the coming of the Europeans]'. At , South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a  of 'more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. AD 1325)' ".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It is problematic however to suggest that people in past societies are any more violent than people today. Martin and colleagues in their recent book have pulled together some of the foremost researchers studying violence in the past to show that though there may be events like massacres in the past, like today the use and manifestation of warfare varies greatly both within and between societies.
 
In Western Europe, since the late , more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name=War&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One &#8211; A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 &#8211; 18 Understanding the Great War'', by St&#233;phane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt; During the , war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.&lt;ref name = "Kolko 1994 xviitoxviii"&gt;: "War in this century became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of European politics during 1917&#8211;18 and of all world affairs after 1941".&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see ), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the , and its successor, the United Nations.
Shortly after , as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the .
In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed ,  famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref name = "EinsteinWWIV"&gt; Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper
&lt;/ref&gt;
Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue, and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even advocated for the proclamation of another world war.&lt;ref&gt;NPR: [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5593631 Has World War III Begun?] July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The  documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the  in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J. Wilkenfield and T. nevertheless the concept war is more than just a word but a signification to the meaning Death. Gurr ''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/pc/ Peace and Conflict 2008]'', Paradigm Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The anticipated costs of a possible third world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are of course the two World Wars, then followed by the  (which is sometimes considered part of , or overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all other war-death-tolls by a factor of two. This may be due to significant recent advances in weapons technologies, as well as recent increases in the overall human population.

War, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other  by armed forces employing  and  within the broad  subject to .  by military theorists throughout  have sought to identify the , and to reduce it to a .
In general, modern military science considers several factors before a  is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.
 is an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.
The opposite of conventional warfare, , is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.
 is warfare in which s are the primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.
Civil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.
 is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric conflicts often result in  tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.
Intentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called . Poison gas as a  was principally used during , and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries. Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as  and , are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.
The environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops' mobility and limitations.

The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in ,  and . Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in World War I by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert. 1984. ''The Evolution of Cooperation.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of non-aggression, also from World War I, are detailed in "." These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of World War I was the .
The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of . The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Soldiers subject to combat in war often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, , disease, injury, and death.
During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; In Civil War Collector&#8217;s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest that most soldiers resist firing their weapons in combat, that &#8211; as some theorists argue &#8211; human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; Swank and Marchand&#8217;s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving soldiers will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;
Additionally, it has been estimated that anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from .&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;
Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the , including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers.  since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European soldiers who were mobilized in , 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Martin (2000), ''[http://www.jimmyatkinson.com/papers/versaillestreaty.html#endnotes The Treaty of Versailles and its Consequences]'', New York: Longman&lt;/ref&gt;
During 's retreat from Moscow, more French soldiers died of  than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus]. Joseph M. Conlon.&lt;/ref&gt; Felix Markham thinks that 450,000 crossed the  on 25 June 1812, of whom less than 40,000 recrossed in anything like a recognizable military formation.&lt;ref&gt;See a large copy of the chart here: http://www.adept-plm.com/Newsletter/NapoleonsMarch.htm, but discussed at length in Edward Tufte, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' (London: Graphics Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; More soldiers were killed from 1500&#8211;1914 by typhus than from all military action during that time combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if it were not for the modern medical advances there would be thousands of more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the , the  reported that it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were 'missing'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Turberville (2006). ''Johnson's England: An Account of the Life &amp; Manners of His Age''. ISBN READ BOOKS. p.53. ISBN 1-4067-2726-1&lt;/ref&gt;
It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to , disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as , while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. During the  in Europe, for example, the population of the  states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618&#8211;48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe &#8211; Demographics]. Encyclop&#230;dia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; The  armies alone may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles, 18,000 villages and 1,500 towns in Germany, one-third of all German towns.&lt;ref name="Population-HLS"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Estimates for the total  vary, but most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, comprising around 20 million soldiers and 40 million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  lost around  during the war, about half of all World War II casualties.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men, the postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million fewer than post&#8211;1939 projections would have led one to expect.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of civilian deaths in a single city was 1.2 million citizens dead during the 872-day .
Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay  to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of  has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.
Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the . In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (High government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the ) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the , and , warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the .
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the . The  of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the .&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html "World War II"] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P.

By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the  was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;'''', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;
The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war, usually depend on the . Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a , they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the  territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a , such as the  of 1919, which ended the .
A warring party that  or  may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An  is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the  gave an unconditional surrender to the  after the  (see ), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through  or bluffing.
Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the  of the  between the n city of  and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.
Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised  may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side. A raid for the purposes of  may be completed with the successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the .
Some hostilities, such as  or civil war, may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease active military engagement but still threaten each other. A good example is the  which was essentially over by 1950, but in the second half of the 20th Century the People's Republic of China began fighting to isolate the  (commonly known as ) diplomatically, and still sporadically threatens the island with an invasion. For this reason, some historians consider the war not ended but continuing.

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, , , and the . In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against international terrorism that caused the . Protests  occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the United States. Organizations like , based in the United Kingdom, work on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist significant worldwide . Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and perceived illegitimacy. 
The , with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Governments also use the method of  to stop and prevent the cost of war.
There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the , Rome's leaders may have wished to make war with  for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.
An interpretation of the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between  in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economics, B) Power, and C) Religion.&lt;ref name = "MidrashQuote"&gt; Analysis of Midrash re: Cain &amp; Abel
&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Why Nations Go to War'', by , the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on .
As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war.  said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593&lt;/ref&gt; The one constant factor is war&#8217;s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.
Dutch psychoanalyst  held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."&lt;ref name = "meerloo"&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p.134, Progressive Press, ISBN 978-1-61577-376-3
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.
Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and  have argued that human beings are  violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by  and  where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other , religions, nations or . By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.
The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of , thought that war was the paranoid or projective &#8220;elaboration&#8221; of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our &#8220;love need&#8221;: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.
Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as  and . Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population density and political organization and competition over resources. The other school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;
This school argues that since organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate species such as s,&lt;ref name = "ApesWar"&gt; Analysis of chimpanzee war behavior
&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as in many  species,&lt;ref name = "AntsLandmines"&gt; Scholarly comparisons between human and ant wars
&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior. Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Crofoot, Margaret C. and Richard W. Wrangham, 2010 "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified Theory" in Kappeler, Thomas M &amp; Joan B Silk (eds) ''Mind the Gap &#8211; tracing the origins of human universals''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and large-scale state formations.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;
One line of evidence for violent conflict among the ancestors of humans is . In species that have high levels of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our nearest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewin and Robert Foley. 2004 Principles of human evolution, 2nd ed.p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; The strength difference is greater for upper-body strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger, faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important factor in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 in his book '''' argues that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and s were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible  against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for  as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (""). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.
 strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the  of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Crofoot and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".&lt;ref name=HumanPrimateAggression&gt;"Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals" By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for s and for wealth. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme  of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt; and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: , 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. '' in European and American Thought, 1860&#8211;1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', , 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including  and US , expressed support for an economic view of war.
The  theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great () powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the  and . Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a , over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher  theorized that  was the result of capitalist countries needing new . Expansion of the  is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in . Since the workers in a  would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and  theories.
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.
 in 1095, on the eve of the , spoke:
This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources.  (1766&#8211;1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the , where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where  has dramatically slowed the increase in population.
 theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts &#8211; as graphically represented as a "youth bulge" in a  &#8211; with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.
While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, 'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of .
Contributors to the development of  theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,&lt;ref&gt;Bouthoul, Gaston: "L`infanticide diff&#233;r&#233;" (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sociologist ,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, Jack A.: "Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World", Berkeley 1991; Goldstone, Jack A.: "Population and Security: How Demographic Change can Lead to Violent Conflict", [http://www.mafhoum.com/press6/179S21.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. political scientist Gary Fuller,&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Gary: "The Demographic Backdrop to Ethnic Conflict: A Geographic Overwiew", in: CIA (Ed.): "The Challenge of Ethnic Conflict to National and International Order in the 1990s", Washington 1995, 151&#8211;154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Gary (2003): "The Youth Factor: The New Demographics of the Middle East and the Implications for U.S. Policy"[http://www.brook.edu/fp/projects/islam/fuller2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist .&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Heinsohn (2003): "S&#246;hne und Weltmacht: Terror im Aufstieg und Fall der Nationen" ("Sons and Imperial Power: Terror and the Rise and Fall of Nations"), Zurich 2003), available online as free download (in German) [http://www.pdf4ebook-verlag.de/ShneundWeltmacht.html#Zweig4]; see also the review of this book by G&#246;ran Therborn: "Nato&#180;s Demographer", New Left Review 56, March/April 2009, 136&#8211;144 [http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&amp;view=2775]&lt;/ref&gt;  has modified his  theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:
Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General  referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with s as high as 4&#8211;8 children per woman with a 15&#8211;29-year delay.
A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a  rate leading to .
Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4&#8211;8 children per mother implies 2&#8211;4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many "angry young men" find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are
# Demographically superfluous,
# Might be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and
# Often have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. ''See: , ''.
The combination of these  factors according to Heinsohn&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; usually heads for one of six different exits:
# Emigration ("non-violent ")
# Violent Crime
# Rebellion or 
# Civil war and/or revolution
#  (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)
#  (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).
Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism and today's "Islamist" civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century."

Rationalist theories of war assume that both sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since , that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.
Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility,  with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. 1995. "Rationalist Explanations for War." International Organization 49, 3: 379&#8211;414. [http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/fearon-io1995v49n3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the  in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.
A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as , is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.
Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the bargaining  by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that  only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.
The American decision to enter the  was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose .
Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2002. "Bargaining Theory and International Conflict." ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 5: 1&#8211;30.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.
Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship. Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.
Rationalist theories are usually explicated with , for example, the , not a  as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by  following . More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the .
There are several different  schools. Supporters of  argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.
Which sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are  do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the . Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.
Another major theory relating to  and '''' is the , which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of  being destabilized by a  which does not support the hegemons' control.
Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.&lt;ref name = "MilitaryAdventurism"&gt; Leaders may use war as instant popularity boost
&lt;/ref&gt;
The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to serious  questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: , who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.
There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; First is  (literally translated as "right to war"), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions &#8211; namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. , which literally translates to "right in war", are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in ''jus in bello'' are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"/&gt;
The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in 's regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"/&gt;
These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps:  and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.
Marxism, and other such  ideals, hold that history advances through a set of  (as stated by : thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that history advances through violence. , in fact, held the belief that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple Capitalism and free the . In these theories, the question of ethics has no place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the revolution or synthesis.
Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as , Racism, and , hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish. These are broad  for the general position that .

The English word '''love''' can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure ("I loved that meal") to  ("I love my partner"). It can refer to an  of a strong  and personal .&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be a  representing human , , and affection&#8212;"the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love Merriam Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; And it may describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 1956"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of interpersonal attraction, four forms of love have traditionally been distinguished, based on ancient Greek precedent: the love of kinship or  (in , ''''), the love of  (''''), the love of sexual and/or  (''''), and  or divine love ('''').&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, '''', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="PlatonicSchool"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;, in his book ''On Love'' (Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called "taste-love", and love of vanity.  in his book ''Love in the Western World'' traced the story of passionate love (''l'amour-passion'') from its courtly to its romantic forms. , in the introduction to his ''Anthology of Sublime Love'' (Paris, 1956), further distinguished "sublime love", a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love.&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-Western traditions have also distinguished .&lt;ref name="Gita"&gt; (J. Mascar&#243;, translator)&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define,  compared to other emotional states.
Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why we love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The word "love" can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often, other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on "love" to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of   in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the nature or  of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with  (or neutral ); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with ; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with , although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships.
When discussed in the abstract, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing (cf. ), including oneself (cf. ). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after , although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a , and there are a number of common s regarding love, from  "" to ' "". , following , defines love as "to will the good of another."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  describes love as a condition of "absolute value," as opposed to . Philosopher  said that love is "to be delighted by the happiness of another."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist  defines love as "unconditional selflessness".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-love/ ''What is love?''. In ''The Book of Real Answers to Everything!'' Griffith, J. 2011. ISBN 9781741290073.&lt;/ref&gt;
Love is sometimes referred to as being the "international language", overriding cultural and linguistic divisions.
A person can be said to love an object, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with  and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (September 5, 2000), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt; People can also "love" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another.  refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with .&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as .
Throughout history,  and  have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of  has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of , , , and  have added to the understanding of the nature and function of love.
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a ian drive, much like  or .&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; , a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name="brain systems"&gt;
http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf De&#64257;ning the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name="brain systems" /&gt;
 is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes , and involves the increased release of chemicals such as  and . These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months.  is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in  have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including , , , and , which act in a manner similar to s, stimulating the brain's  and leading to side effects such as increased ,  and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships.  is the  that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as  and , or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals  and  to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name="human"/&gt;  and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the  (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon.   formulated a  and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (1986). "A triangular theory of love". Psychological Review 93 (2): 119&#8211;135. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist  sought to define ''love'' by  in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Following developments in electrical theories such as , which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as "opposites attract." Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality&#8212;people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various  theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of , whose work in the field of  explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the "concern for the spiritual growth of another," and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name="peck"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.
Psychologist  maintained in his book '''' that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the "feeling" of love is superficial in comparison to ones commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, ones self, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt; Fromm also described Love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name="Fromm, Erich 2000"/&gt;
 has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans comparative to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced , injury to the fetus, and increase complications during . This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to  or .&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by s (such as ),  (such as ), and s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in  is that there are two major drives in love:  and . Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of  and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by  (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.
 distinguishes  in which the word "love" is used. For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the  has examples of the  ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''''.
'''' ( ''ag&#225;p&#275;'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a "pure,"  of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as "love of the soul."
'''' ( ''&#233;r&#333;s'') (from the Greek deity ) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''.  refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as "love of the body."
'''' ( ''phil&#237;a''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by . It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean "love of the mind."
'''' ( ''storg&#275;'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.
'''' (&#958;&#949;&#957;&#943;&#945; ''xen&#237;a''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in . It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout &#8212;in particular,  '''' and ''''.
The  has several different verbs corresponding to the English word "love." '''' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive '''' (&#8220;to love&#8221;) as it still is in  today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''&#8212;a lover, amator, "professional lover," often with the accessory notion of lechery&#8212;and ''amica'', "girlfriend" in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, &#8212;in Latin: ''Roma''&#8212;can be viewed as an  for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K&#246;ves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''&#8212;"friend"&#8212;and ''amicitia'', "friendship" (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to "indebtedness" or "influence"). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called '''' (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from  to overprotective parents.
Latin sometimes uses ''am&#257;re'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by ''placere'' or ''delect&#257;re'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of . ''Diligere'' often has the notion "to be affectionate for," "to esteem," and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of "diligence" or "carefulness," and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote "esteem" or "affection." '''' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean "charitable love"; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan . As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.
Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from  which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from  which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is ''''  ("benevolent love", &#20161;), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.
The concept of ''Ai'' (&#24859;) was developed by the Chinese philosopher  in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of "universal love" (''ji&#257;n'&#224;i'', &#20860;&#24859;). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in , the term ''Ai'' (&#24859;) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.
In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (&#24859;) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. ''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' &#25105;&#24859;&#20320;, or "I love you") and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' &#24859;&#24773;, or "romantic love"). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase &#8216;Wo ai ni&#8217; (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying "I love you" as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, "I like you" (''Wo xihuan ni'', &#25105;&#21916;&#27426;&#20320;) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, "[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You]"&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', &#22909;&#12365;&#12384;). The Chinese are also more likely to say "I love you" in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.
,  and  are icons of the passion and love that the  and language present. The Persian word for love is ''eshgh'' , derived from the Arabic ''ishq'', however is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for 'doost dashtan' ('liking'). In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life . Over seven centuries ago, Sa'di wrote:
In , ''ai'' (&#24859;) is passionate caring love, and a fundamental desire. It can develop towards either selfishness or selflessness and enlightenment. '''' (&#29976;&#12360;), a Japanese word meaning "indulgent dependence," is part of the child-rearing . Japanese mothers are expected to hug and indulge their children, and children are expected to reward their mothers by clinging and serving. Some s have suggested that Japanese social interactions in later life are modeled on the mother-child amae.
In , the word "love" comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can "love" just one special person, which they call the word "a&#351;k." '''' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being "in love" (A&#351;&#305;k), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (A&#351;&#305;k) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for , such as  (e&#351;q) and  (&#1171;&#1072;&#1096;&#1099;&#1179;).
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman&#8212;''eros'' in Greek&#8212;and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as "ascending" and "descending" love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name="vatican1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several Greek words for "love" that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* '''': In the , ''agap&#275;'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way  is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.
* '''': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as "brotherly love."
* Two other , '''' (sexual love) and '''' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.
 believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your  as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the  of the Jewish , according to ; cf.  chapter 12, verses 28&#8211;34).  summarized this when he wrote "''Love God, and do as thou wilt''."
 glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poem in , he wrote, "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres." ( 13:4&#8211;7, )
 wrote, ''"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."'' ( 3:16&#8211;17, NIV) John also wrote, ''"Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."'' ( 4:7&#8211;8, NIV)
Saint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, ''&#8220;I was in love with love.&#8221;'' Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as ''&#8220;jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.&#8221;'' According to Saint Augustine, to love God is ''&#8220;to attain the peace which is yours.&#8221;'' (Saint Augustine's Confessions)
Christian  see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian  wrote a book called ''''.  wrote his first  on "". He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others () and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as  and the  and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name="vatican1"/&gt;
In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by , who defined love as "to will the good of another," or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;  This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies.  As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.
In , ''Ahava'' is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. , often translated as , is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.
The commandment to love other people is given in the , which states, "Love your neighbor like yourself" ( 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love  "with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might" ( 6:5) is taken by the  (a central text of the Jewish ) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5).  differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: "See life with the wife you love" ( 9:9). The biblical book  is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between  and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century   is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as "giving without expecting to take" (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.1).
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God (), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or "the Loving One," which is found in Surah  as well as Surah . God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the "Most Compassionate" and the "Most Merciful", indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being "full of loving kindness."
The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or "deep kindness" as stated in Surah . ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.
'''', or divine love, is the emphasis of  in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God "looks" at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love. God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being "drunk" due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In , '''' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to , since it is selfish. '''' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adve&#7779;a'' and '''' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.
The  ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.
In , '''' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god . For many Hindu schools, it is the third end ('''') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of  and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort  and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in , . ''Maara'' is another name for ''k&#257;ma''.
In contrast to ''k&#257;ma'', ''a''or ''prem''refers to elevated love. '''' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a  term, meaning "loving devotion to the supreme God." A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of '''', which can be found in the  and works by . The philosophical work ''s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be ), distinguishes eleven forms of love.
In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unaldulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)&#8212;two opposites .&lt;ref name="Krishna Prema"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything&#8212;one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the  and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.
In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God (taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya), and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination (krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya).  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name="Perfect Love"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The term '''free love''' has been used &lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] of the  claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a  that rejects , which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement&#8217;s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, , and . It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. "The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism." Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of , and reflects a  philosophy that seeks  from  regulation and  interference in s. According to this concept, the s of s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the , this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a  of a new , anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;
Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to "fulfill earthly human happiness." Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision on strongly defined gender roles, which led to the advancement of the free love movement.&lt;ref name="Spurlock, John C 1988"&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with  in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the  and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that love relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.
The term "'''sex radical'''" is also used interchangeably with the term "free lover", and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of "free love". By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name="Passet, Joanne E 2003"&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago,IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also beliefs of .
Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate  and , as well as , , , , and sometimes ; although not all free love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern&#8212;for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize  or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled  laws.
Philosophy of love is the field of  and  which attempts to  the nature of love. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love; asking if and how love is/can be justified; asking what the  of love is; and what impact love has on the  of both the lover and the beloved.
There are many different theories which attempt to  what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are:  theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are  which hold that love is part of the process of ; there are  which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a .

In , , and their many subsets, '''emotion''' is the generic term for ,   that is characterized primarily by  , , and . Emotion is often associated and considered  with , , , , and , as well as influenced by s and s such as , , ,  and . Emotion is often the driving force behind , positive or negative.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 6"&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. ISBN 978-0-13-111529-3, Chapter 6, p 121-142.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book "Psychology", Schacter defines emotion as a "positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity." &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. PSYCHOLOGY. Worth Publishers, 2011. p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;
The  of emotion is closely linked to  of the  with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions. Although those acting primarily on emotion may seem as if they are not thinking,  is an important aspect of emotion, particularly the interpretation of events. For example, the experience of fear usually occurs in response to a threat. The cognition of danger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system (e.g. rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is an integral component to the subsequent interpretation and labeling of that arousal as an emotional state. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. 
Research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including , , , , , and even . The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology, experience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic.  The current research that is being conducted about the concept of emotion involves the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion.  In addition  and  scans help study the affective processes in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T &amp; Gardner, W.L (1999).  Emotion.  "Annual Review of Psychology", 191.&lt;/ref&gt;
The word "emotion" dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word ''&#233;mouvoir'', which means "to stir up". However, the earliest precursors of the word likely dates back to the very origins of language.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Emotions have been described as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism. Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, , , and  mechanisms. Emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of  because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Emotion can be differentiated from a number of similar constructs within the field of :
* '''s''' are best understood as a  representation of emotions, private to the individual experiencing them.
* '''''' are  affective states that generally last for much longer durations than emotions and are also usually less intense than emotions.
* '''''' is an encompassing term, used to describe the topics of emotion, feelings, and moods together, even though it is commonly used interchangeably with emotion.
In  components processing model of emotion,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; five crucial elements of emotion are said to exist. From the component processing perspective, emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of  as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and  are separate but interacting systems, the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.
* '''Cognitive appraisal:''' provides an evaluation of events and objects
* '''Bodily symptoms:''' the  component of emotional experience
* '''Action tendencies:''' a al component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
* '''Expression:'''  and  expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions
* '''Feelings:''' the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred
A distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions. Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel  more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of "affective states" where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as pleasure and pain, motivational states (for example,  or ), moods, dispositions and traits.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N. H. (1990). Feelings as information: Informational and motivational functions of affective states. Handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior, 2, 527-561.&lt;/ref&gt;
The classification of emotions has mainly been researched from two fundamental viewpoints. The first viewpoint is that emotions are discrete and fundamentally different constructs while the second viewpoint asserts that emotions can be characterized on a dimensional basis in groupings.
For more than 40 years,  has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most famous work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another infamous study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: , , , ,  and .&lt;ref name=Handel&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the "wheel of emotions", suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus distrust; and surprise versus anticipation.&lt;ref name=Handel&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way s combine, ''primary emotions'' could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal  and  could blend to form . Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik , R. (2002). Nature of emotions. American Scientist,89, 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
Emotions are controlled by a constellation of interacting brain systems, but the  appears to play a particularly crucial role. According to LeDoux (1996), sensory inputs that can trigger fear (such as seeing a snake while walking) arrive in the thalamus and then are routed along a fast pathway directly to the amygdala and along a slow pathway that allows the cortex time to think about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, W. &amp; McCann, D. (2007). Psychology: Themes &amp; Variety 2nd Canadian ed. Nelson Education Ltd: Thompson Wadsworth Publisher. ISBN 978-0-17-647273-3&lt;/ref&gt;
Through the use of , psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences, which allows a visual depiction of the "emotional distance" between experiences. A further step can be taken by looking at the map's dimensions of the emotional experiences. The emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as  (how negative or positive the experience was) and  (extent of reaction to stimuli). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map.&lt;ref name="&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Theories about emotions stretch back to at least as far as the stoics of Ancient Greece and Ancient China. In the latter it was believed that excess emotion caused damage to '''', which in turn, damages the vital organs.&lt;ref name="Suchy 2011"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The four humours theory made popular by  contributed to the study of emotion in the same way that it did for . 
 regarded emotion in varying ways. In  theories it was seen as a hindrance to  and therefore a hindrance to virtue.  believed that emotions were an essential component to .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to an appetite or capacity. During the , the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by  and  &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in particular. There are also theories in the works of philosophers such as , , &lt;ref&gt;See for instance Antonio Damasio (2005) ''Looking for Spinoza''.&lt;/ref&gt; and . In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an  psychiatric perspective.
;19th Century
Perspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated in the late 19th century with 's book ''''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1872). ''The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals''. Note: This book was originally published in 1872, but has been reprinted many times thereafter by different publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin argued that emotions actually served a purpose for humans, in communication and also in aiding their survival. Darwin therefore argued that emotions evolved via  and therefore have universal  counterparts. Darwin also detailed the virtues of experiencing emotions and the parallel experiences that occur in animals (see ). This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion. 
;Contemporary
More contemporary views along the  spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 6"/&gt; Current research suggests that emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in  has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by  and .  
Research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see ). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 6"/&gt; Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.&lt;ref name = "Gaulin 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robert. Moral animal.&lt;/ref&gt;
 theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from William James in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as ,&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T. (1998). Somatic responses to psychological stress: The reactivity hypothesis.Advances in psychological science, Vol. 2, pp. 87-114. East Sussex, United Kingdom: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; ,&lt;ref&gt;Aziz-Zadeh L, Damasio A. (2008) Embodied semantics for actions: findings from functional brain imaging. J Physiol Paris.

S., &amp; Emerick, S. W. (1997). Facial movement, breathing, temperature, and affect: Implications of the vascular theory of emotional efference. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 11(2), 171-195.&lt;/ref&gt; who are able to appeal to neurological evidence.
In his 1884 article&lt;ref name=James&gt;. 1884. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/emotion.htm "What Is an Emotion?"] ''''. 9, no. 34: 188-205.&lt;/ref&gt;  argued that feelings and emotions were ''secondary'' to  phenomena. In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an "exciting fact" led directly to a physiological response, known as "emotion." To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist  also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the . As James wrote, "the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, ''is'' the emotion." James further claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be."&lt;ref name=James/&gt;
An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, James, ''Feelings: the Perception of Self'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions: e.g. "I'm crying because I'm sad," or "I ran away because I was scared." The issue with the James&#8211;Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being ''a priori''), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).&lt;ref&gt;Reisenzein, R. (1995). James and the physical basis of emotion: A comment on ellsworth. Psychological review, 102(4), 757-761. doi: 0033-295X&lt;/ref&gt;
Although mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Dalgleish, T. (2004). The emotional brain. ''Nature: Perspectives'', 5, 582&#8211;89.&lt;/ref&gt;
 agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain  emotional experiences. He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1929 399&#8211;421"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion. 
Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the  (particularly the ), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that is was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1929 399&#8211;421"/&gt;
 formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, , who injected patients with  and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Maranon found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.  The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With his student, , Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) ''Gut Reactions''.
With the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts was entirely necessary for an emotion to occur. One of the main proponents of this view was  who argued that emotions must have some cognitive . The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.
Lazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order: 
# Cognitive appraisal&#8212;The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion. 
# Physiological changes&#8212;The cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response. 
# Action&#8212;The individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react. 
For example: Jenny sees a snake. 
# Jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. Cognition allows her to understand it as a danger. 
# Her brain activates Adrenaline gland which pumps Adrenaline through her blood stream resulting in increased heartbeat. 
# Jenny screams and runs away. 
Lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.
 provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (Mind and Emotion, 1975, and Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress, 1984)
There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgements, evaluations, or thoughts is necessary in order for an emotion to occur.
A prominent philosophical exponent is  (for example, ''The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life'', 1993). Solomon  claims that emotions are judgements. He has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the &#8216;standard objection&#8217; to cognitivism, the idea that a judgement that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgement cannot be identified with emotion.
The theory proposed by  where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example.
It has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.&lt;ref&gt;see the Heuristic&#8211;Systematic Model, or HSM, (Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1989) under . Also see the index entry for "Emotion" in "Beyond Rationality: The Search for Wisdom in a Troubled Time" by Kenneth R. Hammond and in "Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.&lt;/ref&gt; The  (AIM) is a theoretical model developed by Joseph Forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.
;Perceptual theory
Theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion (Goldie, 2007).A recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves ''perceive'' the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book ''Gut Reactions'' and psychologist James Laird's book ''Feelings''.
;Affective events theory
This is a communication-based theory developed by Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano (1996), that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in work contexts). This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. This theoretical frame also emphasizes ''time'' in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes&#8212; a "series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme." This theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by Howard M. Weiss and Daniel J. Beal in their article, "Reflections on Affective Events Theory" published in ''Research on Emotion in Organizations'' in 2005.
A situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino , emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the  approach in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul Edmund and Scarantino, Andrea (2005) Emotions in the wild: The situated perspective on emotion.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion.  In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms.  Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms.  In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms.  The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world.  Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.
Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the , the  explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the . If distinguished from reactive responses of s, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general  arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, , , and ) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures, and postures.
For example, the emotion of  is proposed to be the expression of  of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the ) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of   for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of s in the ,  and .
The motor centers of  react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active s, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the  sense, which is proposed to have developed into ian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in  to succeed at night as reptiles slept&#8212;one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.
Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by  (1878),  (1937), and  (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the , which includes the , , , and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these  are not as directly related to emotion as others are, while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.
In 2011, L&#246;vheim proposed a direct relation between specific combinations of the levels of the signal substances ,  and  and eight basic emotions. A model was presented where the signal substances form the axes of a coordinate system, and the eight basic emotions according to  are placed in the eight corners. Anger is, according to the model, for example produced by the combination of low serotonin, high dopamine and high noradrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;L&#246;vheim H. A new three-dimensional model for emotions and monoamine neurotransmitters. Med Hypotheses (2011), Epub ahead of print.  PMID 22153577&lt;/ref&gt;
There is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach.&lt;ref&gt;Kringelbach, M.L.; O'Doherty, J.O.; Rolls, E.T.; &amp; Andrews, C. (2003). Activation of the human orbitofrontal cortex to a liquid food stimulus is correlated with its subjective pleasantness. ''Cerebral Cortex'', 13, 1064&#8211;1071.&lt;/ref&gt; If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively. This was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli&lt;ref&gt;Drake, R.A. (1987). Effects of gaze manipulation on aesthetic judgments: Hemisphere priming of affect. ''Acta Psychologica'', 65, 91&#8211;99.&lt;/ref&gt; and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Merckelbach, H.; &amp; van Oppen, P. (1989).

Two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. The Valence Model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. The Direction Model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. The second model was supported.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, E.; Vaughn-Scott, K.; Mohr, S.; Sigelman, J.; &amp; Harmon-Jones, C. (2004). The effect of manipulated sympathy and anger on left and right frontal cortical activity. ''Emotion'', 4, 95&#8211;101.&lt;/ref&gt;
This still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (Direction Model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (Movement Model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (Action Tendency Model). Support for the Action Tendency Model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, L.A. (1999). Frontal brain electrical activity in shyness and sociability.

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 96, 8301&#8211;8306.&lt;/ref&gt; Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the Action Tendency Model.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, R.A.; &amp; Myers, L.R.

Another neurological approach distinguishes two classes of emotion: "classical" emotions such as love, anger and fear that are evoked by environmental stimuli via distance receptors in the eyes, nose and ears; and "homeostatic"&lt;ref name=Craig2003&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (or "primordial"&lt;ref name="Denton2006p7"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) emotions &#8211; feelings such as pain, hunger and fatigue, evoked by internal body states communicated to the central nervous system by ,&lt;ref name="Denton2006p7"/&gt; that motivate behavior aimed at maintaining the body's internal milieu at its ideal state.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 defines the latter as "the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behaviour patterns which contrive . They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion--the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act."&lt;ref name="Denton2009"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions.  study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In , emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans.  studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans.  examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In  sub-fields such as  and , scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In , the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In , the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.
 often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In , emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In , the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of , critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to 's concept of . The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/emonet/ EmoNet]&lt;/ref&gt; an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.
In , the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In , a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as  theory and studies of "toughness," aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In , which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in  claims for compensation and in  prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In , emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.
In , emotions are studied in sub-fields such as , the  (for example,  values, and matters of  and ), and the  (see also ). In , scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In  and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In , scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in , a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, ) in a number of unrelated animals.
The  has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and  school of history claims even that some sentiments and , for example , are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions&lt;/ref&gt; Several research centers have sprung up in different countries in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain [http://www.unav.es/centro/cemid/], Sweden and Australia.
Furtherly, research in  suggests that some tic emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of .
We try to regulate our emotions to fit in with the norms of the situation, based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The emotion of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Expectations attached to social roles, such as "acting as man" and not as a woman, and the accompanying "feeling rules" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as  in the case of contemporary institution of . In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaign advertising emphasizing the fear of terrorism.

In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human  display and model emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Fellous, Armony &amp; LeDoux, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In computer science,  is a branch of the study and development of  that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning s, , and .&lt;ref name=TaoTan&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into ,&lt;ref name=James/&gt; the more modern branch of computer science originated with 's 1995 paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf "Affective Computing"] MIT Technical Report #321 ([http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-321-ABSTRACT.html Abstract]), 1995&lt;/ref&gt; on affective computing.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting emotional information begins with passive s which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.
In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were  (1842&#8211;1910) and  (1834&#8211;1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the , a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
 (1911 &#8211; 1991) developed the Affect theory and Script theory. The  introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion , which he called the affect system, was the motivating force in human life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of emotions and their role in mental life is reflected in the unsettled place they have held in the history of ethics. Often they have been regarded as a dangerous threat to morality and rationality; in the romantic tradition, on the contrary, passions have been placed at the center both of human individuality and of the moral life. This ambivalence is reflected in the close connections between the vocabulary of emotions and that of vices and virtues: envy, spite, jealousy, wrath, and pride are some names of emotions that also refer to common vices. Not coincidentally, some key virtues&#8212;love, compassion, benevolence, and sympathy&#8212;are also names of emotions. (On the other hand, prudence, fortitude and temperance consist largely in the capacity to resist the motivational power of emotions.)
The view that emotions are irrational was eloquently defended by the Epicureans and Stoics. For this reason, these Hellenistic schools pose a particularly interesting challenge for the rest of the Western tradition. The Stoics adapted and made their own the Socratic hypothesis that virtue is nothing else than knowledge, adding the idea that emotions are essentially irrational beliefs. All vice and all suffering is then irrational, and the good life requires the rooting out of all desires and attachments. (As for the third of the major Hellenistic schools, the Skeptics, their view was that it is beliefs as such that were responsible for pain. Hence they recommend the repudiation of opinions of any sort.) All three schools stressed the overarching value of &#8220;ataraxia&#8221;, the absence of disturbance in the soul. Philosophy can then be viewed as therapy, the function of which is to purge emotions from the soul (Nussbaum 1994). In support of this, the Stoics advanced the plausible claim that it is psychologically impossible to keep only nice emotions and give up the nasty ones. For all attachment and all desire, however worthy their objects might seem, entail the capacity for wrenching and destructive negative emotions. Erotic love can bring with it the murderous jealousy of a Medea, and even a commitment to the idea of justice may foster a capacity for destructive anger which is nothing but &#8220;furor brevis&#8221;&#8212; temporary insanity, in Seneca's arresting phrase. Moreover, the usual objects of our attachment are clearly unworthy of a free human being, since they diminish rather than enhance the autonomy those that endure them.
he Hellenistic philosophers' observations about nasty emotions are not wholly compelling. Surely it is possible to see at least some emotions as having a positive contribution to make to our moral lives, and indeed we have seen that the verdict of cognitive science is that a capacity for normal emotion appears to be a sine qua non for the rational and moral conduct of life. Outside of this intimate but still somewhat mysterious link between the neurological capacity for emotion and rationality, the exact significance of emotions to the moral life will again depend on one's theory of the emotions. Inasmuch as emotions are partly constituted by desires, as some cognitivist theorists maintain, they will, as David Hume contended, help to motivate decent behavior and cement social life. If emotions are perceptions, and can be more or less epistemically adequate to their objects, then emotions may have a further contribution to make to the moral life, depending on what sort of adequacy and what sort of objects are involved. Max Scheler (1954) was the first to suggest that emotions are in effect perceptions of &#8220;tertiary qualities&#8221; that supervene in the (human) world on facts about social relations, pleasure and pain, and natural psychological facts, a suggestion recently elaborated by Tappolet (2000).
An important amendment to that view, voiced by D'Arms and Jacobson (2000a) is that emotions may have intrinsic criteria of appropriateness that diverge from, and indeed may conflict with, ethical norms. Appropriate emotions are not necessarily moral. Despite that, some emotions, specifically guilt, resentment, shame and anger, may have a special role in the establishment of a range of &#8220;response-dependent&#8221; values and norms that lie at the heart of the moral life. (Gibbard 1990, D'Arms and Jacobson 1993). Mulligan (1998) advances a related view: though not direct perceptions of value, emotions can be said to justify axiological judgments. Emotions themselves are justified by perceptions and beliefs, and are said to be appropriate if and only if the axiological judgments they support are correct. If any of those variant views is right, then emotions have a crucial role to play in ethics in revealing to us something like moral facts. A consequence of this view is that art and literature, in educating our emotions, will have a substantial role in our moral development (Nussbaum 2001). On the other hand, there remains something &#8220;natural&#8221; about the emotions concerned, so that moral emotions are sometimes precisely those that resist the principles inculcated by so-called moral education. Hence the view that emotions apprehend real moral properties can explain our approval of those, like Huckleberry Finn when he ignored his &#8220;duty&#8221; to turn in Jim the slave, whose emotions drive them to act against their own &#8220;rational&#8221; conscience (Bennett 1974; McIntyre 1990).

'''Medicine''' (, ) is the  or practice of the , , and prevention of .&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/ Oxford English Dictionary] definition of "[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/medicine?q=medicine medicine]"&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses a variety of  practices evolved to maintain and restore  by the  and  of  in .
Contemporary medicine applies , , and  to  and treat injury and disease, typically through  or , but also through therapies as diverse as , , , ,  and others. 
The word ''medicine'' is derived from the  ''ars medicina'', meaning ''the art of healing''.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology: : ''medicina'', from ''ars medicina'' "the medical art", from ''medicus'' "physician". ([http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=medicine Etym.Online])
Cf. ''mederi'' "to heal", etym. "know the best course for," from  base *med- "to measure, limit. Cf.  ''medos'' "counsel, plan",  ''vi-mad'' "physician")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=medicine "Medicine"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;
In clinical practice, doctors personally assess patients in order to , treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The  typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's  and , followed a medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a . Basic diagnostic s (e.g. , ) are typically used. After examination for  and interviewing for , the doctor may order s (e.g. s), take a , or prescribe s or other therapies.  methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=AHIMA2005&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Followups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure.
The components of the medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005/&gt; and encounter are:
*Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the 'symptoms.' They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called 'presenting complaint.'
*History of present  / complaint (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom.
*Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
*s (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, , and , as well as alternative and .  are also recorded.
*Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past s and/or s, history of known allergies.
*Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including , medications, , alcohol).
* (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A  is sometimes used.
*Review of systems (ROS) or ''systems inquiry'': a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any , change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (, s, , , etc.).
The  is the examination of the patient looking for signs of disease ('Symptoms' are what the patient volunteers, 'Signs' are what the healthcare provider detects by examination). The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, , ). Taste has been made redundant by the availability of modern lab tests. Four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination: ,  (feel),  (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and  (listen). This order may be modified depending on the main focus of the examination (e.g., a joint may be examined by simply "look, feel, move". Having this set order is an educational tool that encourages practitioners to be systematic in their approach and refrain from using tools such as the  before they have fully evaluated the other modalities).
The clinical examination involves the study of:
*Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, , , respiration rate, and hemoglobin 
*General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or )
*
*Head, eye, , nose, and throat (HEENT)
* ( and s)
* (large airways and )
* and 
*Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
* (including spine and extremities)
* (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, , spinal cord and )
* (orientation, , evidence of abnormal perception or thought).
It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.
 and  results may be obtained, if necessary.
The medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the ), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.
The treatment plan may include ordering additional  tests and studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised.
This process is used by primary care providers as well as specialists. It may take only a few minutes if the problem is simple and straightforward. On the other hand, it may take weeks in a patient who has been hospitalized with bizarre symptoms or multi-system problems, with involvement by several specialists.
On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.
Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within s. Legal, ing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.
From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the  today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States)&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations], Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccuhc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and many  provide medical services through a system of  that aims to guarantee care for all through a  system, or compulsory private or co-operative . This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.
Most  societies, and the United States,&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ccuhc"/&gt; provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.
Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.
Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.
 medical services are provided by , , , or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, s, s, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses,  and  for all ages and both sexes.
 medical services are provided by s in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both  and  services, s, , surgery services, , ,  units, diagnostic  and  services,  centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.
 medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include s,  treatment centers, advanced  unit services, s, high-risk pregnancy,  , etc.
Modern medical care also depends on information &#8211; still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.
Working together as an , many highly trained als besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: s, s and paramedics, laboratory scientists, ,  , , , , radiographers, s, and .
The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. , while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.
A patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the Cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.
Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.
The main branches of medicine are:
* Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in .
* 
* , where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.
*'''' is the study of the physical structure of s. In contrast to ''macroscopic'' or ''gross anatomy'', ''cytology'' and ''histology'' are concerned with microscopic structures.
*'''' is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
*'''' is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of .
*'''' is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to  and evidence-based medicine.

In the broadest meaning of "medicine", there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities will have their own body or college (collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although currently not all use the term "Royal"), which have their own entrance exam. The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (e.g., emergency departments), which leads to the desire to form a unifying body of doctors and thence the prestige of administering their own exam.
Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: "Medicine" and "Surgery." "Medicine" refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in "Internal Medicine". In the UK, this would traditionally have been evidenced by obtaining the MRCP (An exam allowing Membership of the  or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland). "Surgery" refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in "General Surgery." (In the UK: Membership of the  (MRCS).)There are some specialties of medicine that at the present time do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above &#8211; for example anaesthesia developed first as a  of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the  and membership of the college is by sitting the FRCA (Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists).
''Surgical specialties'' employ operative treatment. In addition, surgeons must decide when an operation is necessary, and also treat many non-surgical issues, particularly in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), where a variety of critical issues arise. Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including '', , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .'' In some centers,  is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as  and , but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.
Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming.
'''Internal medicine''' is the medical  concerned with the diagnosis, management and nonsurgical treatment of unusual or serious diseases, either of one particular organ system or of the body as a whole. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called "internists". Elsewhere, especially in  nations, such specialists are often called s.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, ''internist'' or ''physician'' (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.
Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such ''general physicians'' would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, s and s specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the  and some other countries, specialist  and  are also described as ''specialist physicians'' (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of .
There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of :

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on  and  for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the USA. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.
*'' sciences'' are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these  departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate  degree, who actually perform the s, s, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include , , , ,  and .
* '''' is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in . Many modern molecular tests such as ,  (PCR), , , gene rearrangements studies and  (FISH)  fall within the territory of pathology.
*'''' is concerned with imaging of the human body, e.g. by s, x-ray , , and  .
*'''' is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a  or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
*'''' is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include , , ,  and . Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.
The followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above mentioned groups.
*'''' (also known as ''anaesthetics''): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also served the same function in the labor &amp; delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.
*'''' is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
*'''' is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including , surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.
*'''', '''', '''' or ''primary care'' is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency room coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.
*'' and '' (often abbreviated as '''' (American English) or ''Obs &amp; Gynae'' (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs.  and  are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.
*'''' is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.
*'''' is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
*'''' exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.
*'''' (AE) or ''paediatrics'' (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.
*'''' (or ''physiatry'') is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or s.
*''''  study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.

*'''' focuses on delivery of unscheduled, walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department. In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room.
*;  apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals.
*'''' entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.
*Many other  fields, e.g. 
Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university , followed by a period of supervised practice or , and/or . This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a  degree, often abbreviated M.D. or a  degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in a recognized university.
Since knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require . The means through which doctors upgrade their medical knowledge include s, seminars, conferences and online programs apart from others.
Medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:
*  - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (''Voluntas aegroti suprema lex''.)
*  - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (''Salus aegroti suprema lex''.)
*  - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).
*  - "first, do no harm" (''primum non nocere'').
*  - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
* fulness and  - the concept of  has increased in importance since the historical events of the  of the Nuremberg trials and .
Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical  or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members.  For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse , considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.
In most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against s that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in "evidence based", Western, or  Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.
In the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification.
The regulated professions database contains [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?action=profession&amp;id_profession=12401&amp;tab=countries a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine] in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC .
Doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of  and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.
According to , the main problem for modern medicine is lack of access in poor regions. There is an "outcome gap" between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like  and . The majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich, low-incidence regions such as the . On the other hand, countries in the  have high rates of  but lack the resources to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
s and  and other forms of  (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage. Practitioners of   believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in , where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one "superhuman" individual and expect him or her not to make s. Reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice. Clinical versus statistical,  diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by , which found statistical methods superior.&lt;ref name=Grove2000/&gt; A 2000  comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or "mechanical" diagnostic methods were, in general, although not always, superior.&lt;ref name=Grove2000&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Rural poor African-American men were used in an  that denied them basic medical care.
The highest honor awarded in medicine is the , awarded since 1901 by the .

Well-known spiritual systems include  (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits),  (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits);  (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and  (magically obtaining the truth). The field of  examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.
Early records on medicine have been discovered from , ,  medicine (in the ),  (predecessor to the modern ), and  and .   The Egyptian  (3rd millennium BC) is the first physician in history known by name. Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in  where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Arjuna Aluvihare, "Rohal Kramaya Lovata Dhayadha Kale Sri Lankikayo" ''Vidhusara Science Magazine'', November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ihsg/publications/pdf/No-42.PDF Resource Mobilization in Sri Lanka's Health Sector]'' &#8211; Rannan-Eliya, Ravi P. &amp; De Mel, Nishan,  &amp; Health Policy Programme, , February 1997, Page 19.

In Europe,  decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian  likened the  during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The  order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great . The Church also established a network of  and univerities where medicine was studied.

However, the fourteenth and fifteenth century  devastated both the Middle East  and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dols has shown that the Black Death was much more commonly believed by European authorities than by Middle Eastern authorities to be contagious; as a result, flight was more commonly counseled, and in urban Italy quarantines were organized on a much wider level than in urban Egypt or Syria (''The Black Death in the Middle East'' Princeton, 1977, p. 119; 285&#8211;290).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including  and .
The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the  in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general &#8211; see 's rejection of 's theories on astronomy).

Veterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian  founded the world's first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.
Modern scientific  (where results are testable and ) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek "" and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with 's discovery of the  at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of  earlier practiced in Asia), 's discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of s around 1900.

'''Research''' and experimental development is formal work undertaken systematically to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications (OECD (2002) Frascati Manual: proposed standard practice for surveys on research and experimental development, 6th edition.)&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 27 May 2012 from [http://www.oecd.org/sti/frascatimanual www.oecd.org/sti/frascatimanual].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support s, or develop new . A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field.  To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects, or the project as a whole.  The primary purposes of  (as opposed to ) are , , , or the  of methods and systems for the advancement of human . Approaches to research depend on , which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, , etc.
'''Scientific research''' relies on the application of the scientific method, a harnessing of . This research provides  information and theories for the explanation of the  and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution, such as business schools, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate totally).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Research in the humanities''' involves different methods such as for example  and , and a different, more  . Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in . Historians use  and other  to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past.
'''Artistic research''', also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.
The phrase ''my research'' is also used loosely to describe a person's entire collection of  about a particular subject.
The word ''research'' is derived from the  "''recherche''", which means "to go about seeking", the term itself being derived from the  term "''recerchier''" a compound word from "re-" + "cerchier", or "sercher", meaning 'search'.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;
Research has been defined in a number of different ways.
A broad definition of research is given by Martyn Shuttleworth - "In the broadest sense of the word, the definition of research includes any gathering of data, information and facts for the advancement of knowledge."&lt;ref name="Shuttleworth"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Another definition of research is given by Creswell who states - "Research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue". It consists of three steps: Pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). Educational Research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as "a studious inquiry or examination; especially   : investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws".&lt;ref name="Merriam_webster"/&gt;
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research.&lt;ref&gt;Trochim, W.M.K, (2006). Research Methods Knowledge Base.&lt;/ref&gt; The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008 ISBN 0-13-613550-1 (pages 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification of research problem
* Literature review
* Specifying the purpose of research
* Determine specific research questions or hypotheses
* Data collection
* Analyzing and interpreting the data
* Reporting and evaluating research
The steps generally represent the overall process, however they should be viewed as an ever-changing process rather than a fixed set of steps.&lt;ref&gt;Gauch, Jr., H.G. (2003). Scientific method in practice. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 2003 ISBN 0-521-81689-0 (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Most researches begin with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, T.S., Hatcher, T., &amp; Creswell, J.W. (2011). The handbook of scholarly writing and publishing. San Francisco, CA: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2011 ISBN 978-0-470-39335-2&lt;/ref&gt; The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified.  A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question.  The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.  The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as . The results of the data analysis in confirming or failing to reject the  are then reported and evaluated. At the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research.
 says, "... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MTF.CHAP9.HTM Questions About Freedom, Democide, And War]&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural . Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# : Consists of the subject area of ones interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# : A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# : Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# :  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# : Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from and/or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# : Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data in order to draw conclusions about it.
# : This can be represented through tables, figures and pictures, and then described in words.
# 
# 
A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, ). Generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment.  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see ). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.
A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which state no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables. A null hypothesis uses a sample of all possible people to make a conclusion about the population.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008).

There are various history guidelines commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes  and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:&lt;ref name="Garraghan  (1946)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* , which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* , which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* , which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence.
There are two major types of research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:
;
:Understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior. Asking a broad question and collecting data in the form of words, images, video etc that is analyzed searching for themes. This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables. It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time consuming, and typically limited to a single set of research subjects. Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.  Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of .
;
:Systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships. Asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze utilizing  methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive).&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). ''Educational Research:  Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ. Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of .
The Quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories. These methods produce results that are easy to summarize, compare, and generalize. Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory and/or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.  Depending on the research question, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment).  If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics in order to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.uwec.edu/piercech/ResearchMethods/Data%20collection%20methods/DATA%20COLLECTION%20METHODS.htm Data Collection Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;
In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data.  Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires.  Secondary data is data that already exists, such as  data, which can be re-used for the research.  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.102. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.114. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 describes a system that is necessary in order for academic s to  the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field, and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and .
Most established  have their own journals and other outlets for publication, though many s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields; from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its factors in order to prevent the publication of unproven findings.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; s are different in the electronic environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and , where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.
Most funding for  comes from three major sources:   departments; s, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and government research councils such as the  in the USA&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the  in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research, but also as a source of merit.
The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.
'''Original research''' is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a  character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new , rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form (''e.g.'', summarized or classified).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html ''What is Original Research? Original research is considered a primary source.'' Thomas G. Carpenter Library]  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XlIH4R9Z_k8C&amp;pg=PT75 Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers - Laurie Rozakis]&lt;/ref&gt;
Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In al work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject, e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In  work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in s and usually established by means of .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; s are commonly required to perform original research as part of a .&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oFFWt5oyA3oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22original+research%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22original%20research%22&amp;f=false Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition - The United States Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines.&lt;ref name=""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the characteristics of istic research is that it must accept  as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the s in using  and  as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Artistic research has been defined by the  (Dans och Cirkush&#246;gskolan, DOCH),  in the following manner - "Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."&lt;ref name="DOCH"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, M.

Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction, also have to do research to support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman A (2003) Research for Writers, pp 4-5. London: A&amp;C Black Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of  and , and has been carried out from as far back as the time of   if not before.

The word '''' (or ''"sociologie"'') is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The  word: '''', "companion"; ''-ology'', "the study of", and in  , ''l&#243;gos'', "word", "knowledge". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist  (1748&#8211;1836) in an unpublished .&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Siey&#232;s. 1773&#8211;1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Faur&#233;, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Fran&#231;oise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007.

''Sociology'' 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: . pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte had earlier used the term "social physics", but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician . Comte endeavored to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the , he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological , an epistemological approach outlined in '''' [1830&#8211;1842] and '''' (1848). Comte believed a  would mark the final era, after conjectural  and  phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first  in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 (27 April 1820&#8211; 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including , defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim&#8217;s '''' is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.&lt;ref name="&#201;mile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer"/&gt; Also a notable , Spencer coined the term "".

Formal academic sociology was established by &#201;mile Durkheim (1858&#8211;1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical . While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the  in 1895, publishing his '''' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000).

Durkheim's seminal monograph, '''' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst  and  populations, distinguished sociological analysis from  or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of . By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or ) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''suis generis'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social ".
Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of , such as , , , and the process of "".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, J&#252;rgen, '': Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, ISBN 0-7456-0830-2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field predominated in , with British  and  generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the . Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with , , psychology and , with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt;
Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist  are typically cited as the three principal architects of social science.&lt;ref name="Max Weber &#8211; Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy"/&gt; , , , , , , , ,  and  are occasionally included on academic curricula as founding theorists.

An emphasis on  and the  is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.
The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt; Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical . The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;
 distinguishes three major strains of positivism: , Logical, and Instrumental.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; While &#201;mile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; He developed the notion of objective ''sui generis'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;
The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed ''instrumental positivism''. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favor of methodological clarity, ,  and .&lt;ref name="Gartell"/&gt; This positivism is more or less synonymous with , and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to ,&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what  called : abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"/&gt;
Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher  voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements"/&gt; 's methodology borrowed from ism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements2"/&gt; He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as  pioneered the distinction between natural and social science (''). Various  philosophers, s and  further theorized how the analysis of the  differs to that of the  due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, , and .&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, H. P. (1960) ''The Reaction against Positivism and Dilthey's Concept of Understanding'', The London School of Economics and Political Science. p307&lt;/ref&gt;
At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological , proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural s, , s, and social processes viewed from a resolutely  perspective.  argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify  of human ""&#8212;especially among "s", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"/&gt; As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as "historical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"/&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, , theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on "" (lit. ''community'' and ''society''). T&#246;nnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").&lt;ref&gt;*Ferdinand T&#246;nnies (ed. Jose Harris), ''Community and Civil Society'', Cambridge University Press (2001), hardcover, 266 pages, ISBN 0-521-56119-1; trade paperback, Cambridge University Press (2001), 266 pages, ISBN 0-521-56782-3&lt;/ref&gt;
Both Weber and  pioneered the "''''" (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Kaern, Phillips &amp; Cohen. (1990) ''Georg Simmel and Contemporary Sociology''. Springer Publishing. ISBN 978-0-7923-0407-4. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the  and  writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;
The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;Abend, Gabriel. 2008. "The meaning of 'Theory'."  Sociological Theory, 26:2&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern sociological theory descends from the historical foundations of functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx) accounts of social structure, as well as the micro-scale structural () and  () theories of social interaction.  Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of these approaches.
Presently, sociological theories lack a single overarching foundation, and there is little consensus about what such a framework should consist of.&lt;ref name="Abend"/&gt; However, a number of broad paradigms cover much present sociological theorizing. In the humanistic parts of the discipline, these paradigms are referred to as ''social'' theory, and are often shared with the humanities.  The discipline's dominant scientifically-oriented areas generally focus on a different set of theoretical perspectives, which by contrast are generally referred to as ''sociological'' theory.  These include , , s, ,  and , toolkit and  theories of , and .  is an ongoing effort to systematize many of these .
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and , functionalism addresses the  as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by ) is to regard s and s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"/&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as ,  and . It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of . As  states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in '''The Giddens Reader''' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;
Functionalism aims only toward a general perspective from which to conduct social science. Methodologically, its principles generally contrast those approaches that emphasize the , such as  or . Its emphasis on "cohesive systems", however, also holds political ramifications. Functionalist theories are often therefore contrasted with "conflict theories" which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality of particular groups. The works of Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively:
The functionalist movement reached its crescendo in the 1940s and 1950s, and by the 1960s was in rapid decline.&lt;ref name="Coakley"/&gt; By the 1980s, functionalism in Europe had broadly been replaced by -oriented approaches.&lt;ref name="Slattery"/&gt; While some of the critical approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically-oriented  with no single overarching theoretical orientation. To many in the discipline, functionalism is now considered "as dead as a dodo."&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;
As the influence of both functionalism and Marxism in the 1960s began to wane, the  and s led to myriad new movements in the social sciences: "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Philip ''The Giddens Reader'' (1993) The Macmillan Press Ltd, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
The  movement originated from the  theory of  and was later expanded to the social sciences by theorists such as . In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the  understanding of human culture as a . One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Assiter, A 1984, 'Althusser and structuralism', The British journal of sociology, vol. 35, no. 2, Blackwell Publishing, pp.272&#8211;296.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The  position has been associated with "," a term used in specific contexts to describe an ''era'' or ''phenomena'', but occasionally construed as a ''method''.
Structure and agency, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '' relates to  factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological  ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"/&gt; A general outcome of incredulity toward structural or agential thought has been the development of multidimensional theories, most notably the  of  and 's .
Sociological research methods may be divided into two broad categories:
*  approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims
*  emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality
Sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between  and data.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt; Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are .) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective,&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; and the very term "methodology" is often used synonymously with "." Practically all sociology PhD program in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public,&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;
The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a  to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's  may choose ethnographic  or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or , quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of .&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;
Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a  or a complete  of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable  of a . In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw s from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as . While it is usually best to , concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for . Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates , such as  or .&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;

Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Using s, , , complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like  analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

For , culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; Whilst early theorists such as  and  were influential in , sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for  (rather than  or ancient) society. Cultural sociology is seldom empirical, preferring instead the  analysis of words, artifacts and symbols. The field is closely allied with  in the vein of , , and other members of the . Loosely distinct to sociology is the field of .  theorists such as  and  questioned the division between "producers" and "consumers" evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power.

Criminologists analyze the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, , and the . The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviors that violate s, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., ) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of deviance is central in contemporary structural functionalism and systems theory.  produced a , and also established the terms "", "", and "".&lt;ref name="Robert K.

The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the "visible symbol" of social solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar, Reza (2009) "Law Through Sociology's Looking Glass: Conflict and Competition in Sociological Studies of Law" in "The new ISA handbook in contemporary international sociology: Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation", Ann Denis, Devorah Kalekin-Fishman, eds., (London: Sage). An e-copy available at [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1327025 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study which examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal s and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial .&lt;ref name="Western"/&gt;
The term "economic sociology" was first used by  in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name="princeton1"/&gt; Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and  as a philosophical concept. The relationship between  and  is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's '''' (1905) and Simmel's '''' (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of  titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness". This work elaborated the concept of , which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part).  has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the  and 's concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.
Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other subfields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become ''defined'' and ''known'' to humans.
The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; A classic 1966 study in this field by , known as the "Coleman Report", analyzed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (''i.e.'' per pupil spending).&lt;ref name="Hanushek"/&gt; The controversy over "school effects" ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for  in American public schools.
Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many subfields of sociology. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an  and unit of , with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the  and its distinct . The notion of "" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. , on the other hand, is a normative subfield that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the  and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bose,Christine. 2012. "Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality" Gender &amp; Society 26(1): 67-72&lt;/ref&gt; "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" is also a concern.&lt;ref&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley, Stephen Benard, In Paik. 2007. "Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?" American Journal of Sociology 112: 1297&#8211;1338.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set of experiments showed that men whose sexuality is questioned compensate by expressing a greater desire for military intervention and sport utility vehicles as well as a greater opposition to gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://willer.berkeley.edu/WillerOverdoingGender.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, es, s,  and the  process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).&lt;ref name="British Sociological Association: Medical Sociology"/&gt;

The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably , and , wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of  through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by  and  in '''' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare ''''). The "archaeological" and "genealogical" studies of  are of considerable contemporary influence.
The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing "with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity."&lt;ref name="socofsci-bendavid"/&gt; Important theorists in the sociology of science include  and . These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of .
Sociology of literature is a subfield of sociology of culture. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 ''Les R&#232;gles de L'Art: Gen&#232;se et Structure du Champ Litt&#233;raire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and J&#252;rgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally-defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.
As with , media studies is a distinct discipline which owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular,  and . Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms is not in the remit of sociologists, analyses of  factors, such as  and , stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline ''per se'', but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.
Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an . It is a highly specialized subfield which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct  with coerced  based on shared  linked to survival in  and , with purposes and  that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns -military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.&lt;ref name="Core Issues and Theory in Military Sociology"/&gt;
Historically political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society.  A typical research question in this area might be: "Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?"&lt;ref&gt;Piven, F. (1988) ''Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way'' Pantheon. ISBN 0-679-72318-8&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical  by .  A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyze socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of  and .&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, S.M. ''Introduction: Ostrogorski and the Analytical Approach to the Comparative Study of Political Parties'' in M. Ostrogorski, Democracy and the Organization of Political (2 vol, 1964; 1982 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change.  Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively.  The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the , political, and economic relations between  and  at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of , , and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as  and , as well as with . At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either  or .&lt;ref&gt;"Milton Louw&#8211; Making A Better World." : Oldest Coloured Owned Business in Namibia.

The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. ISBN 978-0-7425-6111-3&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the  in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what  has described as a position of "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: ISBN 0-385-07305-4&lt;/ref&gt; It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897  rates amongst  and  populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of  and his : '''' (1905), '''' (1915), '''' (1915), and '''' (1920). Contemporary debates often center on topics such as , , and the role of religion in a context of  and .
A social network is a  composed of individuals (or organizations) called "nodes", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of , such as , , financial exchange, dislike, , or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. Social network analysis makes no assumption that groups are the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local  to networks of exchange. Rather than treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses on how the structure of ties affects individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behavior, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. Unlike most other areas of sociology, social network theory is usually defined in .
Sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale . This area may be described as adhering to "sociological miniaturism", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behavior of small groups.&lt;ref name="Sociological miniaturism: seeing the big through the small in social psychology"/&gt; Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behavior, social change, nonverbal behavior, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with .&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the  (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, s, and divisions within a society.
.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Modern  stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: , , and , but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. ).&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"/&gt; Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of  suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. , by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of  in stratified societies.
Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the  in the capitalist system: the  own the means, but this effectively includes the  itself as the workers can only sell their own  (forming the ).  critiqued Marxist , arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. ). According to Weber, stratification may occur amongst at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat.   (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth.  and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  provides a modern example in the concepts of  and .

Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the , works such as 's '''' (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The  produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilising  as a method of field research.

The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines "the direction and implications of trends in  change, , labour markets, work organization,  practices and  to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Tony J. 2008 ''Sociology, Work, and Industry''.

Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular , , , and . Many comparatively new fields such as , ,  and , draw upon methods that originated in sociology.

, in his ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' (1994), has argued that the discipline, whilst arriving from a "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Furthermore: "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism&#8212;to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. , the  Professor in Sociology at the  and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the  journal, has voiced similar sentiments: "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Cited in Horowitz, Irving (1994) ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' Oxford University Press. p3-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wealth''' is the  of  s or material . The  wealth is derived from the old English ''weal'', which is from an  word stem.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An individual, community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources is known as wealthy.
The concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of , and clearly so for  and  yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as "anything of value" which captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.&lt;ref name="goulet"&gt;Denis "Authentic Development: Is it Sustainable?", pp. 189-205 in ''Building Sustainable Societies'', Dennis Pirages, ed., , ISBN 1-56324-738-0, ISBN 978-1-56324-738-5.

In popular usage, wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic , or the state of controlling or possessing such items, usually in the form of ,  and personal . An individual who is considered wealthy, affluent, or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group. In economics,  refers to the value of  owned minus the value of  owed at a point in time. Wealth can be categorized into three principal categories: , including homes or automobiles; monetary savings, such as the accumulation of past ; and the  wealth of income producing assets, including , , , and es. All these delineations make wealth an especially important part of . Wealth provides a type of  of protection against an unforeseen decline in one&#8217;s living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership, business ownership, or even a college education.&lt;ref name="Wadsworth Publishing 2002"/&gt; 
'Wealth' refers to some ''accumulation'' of resources (net asset value), whether abundant or not. 'Richness' refers to an ''abundance'' of such resources (income or flow). A wealthy individual, community, or nation thus has more accumulated resources (capital) than a poor one. The opposite of wealth is destitution. The opposite of richness is .
The term implies a  on establishing and maintaining  in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner. The concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies, but varies between different sections or regions in the same society. A personal  of US $10,000 in most parts of the United States would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale. However, such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished .
Concepts of wealth also vary across time. Modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the  have enabled the poorest sectors of today's society to enjoy a  equivalent if not superior to the wealthy of the not-too-distant past. This comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future; given this trend of human advancement, it is likely that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations.

Economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income.  Wealth is a '''' variable, that is, measurable ''at a date'' in time, for example the value of an orchard on December 31 minus debt owed on the orchard. For a given amount of wealth, say at the beginning of the year,  from that wealth, as measurable ''over'' say a year is a '''' variable. What marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time, such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year.
In  theory the '' may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth. One measure of it is the . It is the percentage change in the amount demanded of  for each one-percent change in wealth.
Wealth may be measured in , that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible ( and ) and ''financial'' (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as  and . In economics, 'wealth' corresponds to the  term ''.

The class standard valuation is different in each country according to their .
 values include higher education, and the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth, the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks. Children of the upper class are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms. It is in large part by accessing various edifices of information, associates, procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations.&lt;ref name="Sherraden, Michael 1991"&gt;Sherraden, Michael.

The middle class places a greater emphasis on income. The  views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion. This class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home, planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement. They earn a significant amount of income and also have significant amounts of consumption. However there is very limited savings (deferred consumption) or investments, besides retirement s and homeownership. They have been socialized to accumulate wealth through structured, institutionalized arrangements. Without this set structure, asset accumulation would likely not occur.&lt;ref name="Sherraden, Michael 1991"/&gt;
Those with the least amount of wealth are the poor. (see ) Wealth accumulation for this class is to some extent prohibited. People that receive  transfers cannot own more than a trivial amount of assets, in order to be eligible and remain qualified for income transfers. Most of the institutions that the poor encounter discourage any accumulation of assets.&lt;ref name="Sherraden, Michael 1991"/&gt;

In the western tradition, the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first , for a primary service and power of government was, and is to this day, the awarding and  of .
Land ownership was also justified according to . He claimed that because we mix our labour with the land, we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land (but subject to his  of "at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.").
Additionally, in developed countries post- () this argument has many critics (including those influenced by  and  ideas) who argue that since land, by definition, is not a product of human labor, any claim of  in it is a form of theft; as  observed, "to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it."
Many older ideas have resurfaced in the modern notions of , , , and .
 characterizes societies, in part, based on a society's concept of wealth, and the institutional structures and  used to protect this wealth. Several types are defined below. They can be viewed as an evolutionary progression.  Many young adolescents have become wealthy from the inheritance of their families.  
Early s seem to have started with incipient ideas of wealth, similar to that of the s. But as tools, , and other mobile  became important to survival (especially in hostile s), ideas such as the  of wealth, political positions,  , and ability to control group movements (to perhaps reinforce such power) emerged.  societies had pooled s and  which implies at least a notion of shared assets that could be spent for social purposes, or preserved for social purposes. Wealth may have been collective.
s back to and including the s seem to have had clearly defined rulers and status hierarchies.   in  have revealed elaborate funeral clothing on a pair of children buried there over 35,000 years ago. This indicates a considerable accumulation of wealth by some individuals or families. The high  skill also suggest the capacity to direct  to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the group's survival.
The rise of  and , especially in ancient  and later , unified the ideas of wealth and control of  and .

Protection of  built up over generations became critical: s, s, s, , s, all impossible to replace within a single generation, and thus a matter of social survival to maintain.

&lt;/ref&gt; In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. Since , science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to . In the  the words "science" and "philosophy" were sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt; (2007), ''The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context'',  Second ed. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press ISBN 978-0-226-48205-7, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century,  (which is today called "") was considered a separate branch of .&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's  (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt; However, "science" continued to be used in a broad sense denoting reliable knowledge about a topic, in the same way it is still used in modern terms such as  or .
In modern use, "science" more often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. It is "often treated as synonymous with 'natural and physical science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws, sometimes with implied exclusion of pure mathematics. This is now the dominant sense in ordinary use."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This narrower sense of "science" developed as scientists such as ,  and  began formulating '''' such as . In this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as "natural science". Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the , a disciplined way to study the natural world, including , ,  and . It is in the 19th century also that the term '''' was created by the naturalist-theologian  to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought knowledge on other disciplines. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834. This sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as . Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of "science", such as  and .
Science in a broad sense existed before the , and in many historical s, but  is so distinct in its  and successful in its  that it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;"The historian ... requires a very broad definition of "science" &#8212; one that ... will help us to understand the modern scientific enterprise. We need to be broad and inclusive, rather than narrow and exclusive ... and we should expect that the farther back we go [in time] the broader we will need to be." &#8212; David Pingree (1992), "Hellenophilia versus the History of Science" ''Isis'' '''83''' 554-63, as cited on p.3,  (2007), ''The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context'',  Second ed. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press ISBN 978-0-226-48205-7&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier than the modern era, another important turning point was the development of the classical  in the ancient Greek-speaking world.
Science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge ( '''',  ''''), rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thinking, as shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as the pyramids. However no consistent distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems.
Before the invention or discovery of the  of "" ( ''phusis''), by the s, the same words tend to be used to describe the ''natural'' "way" in which a plant grows,&lt;ref&gt;See the quotation in  (8th century BCE) &lt;/ref&gt; and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish "nature" and "convention".&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy&#8212; the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or , particularly interested in . In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek ''techn&#275;'') was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss and Cropsey eds. History of Political Philosophy, Third edition, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;
A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by  to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter.
The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates was executed.  later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy, which was , and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a  and  and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the  of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being, they did not argue for any other types of applied science.
Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the "theoretical" steps of  universal rules from raw data, and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.&lt;ref&gt;"... [A] man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty&#8212;for unless he is more certain of his first principles than of the conclusion drawn from them he will only possess the knowledge in question accidentally."&#8212; Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'' '''6''' (H. Rackham, ed.) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139b Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1139b]&lt;/ref&gt;
During  and the , the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomenon was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science, or  as it was called, and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early encyclopedists like . During the early medieval period, Syrian Christians from Eastern Europe such as Nestorians and Monophysites were the ones that translated much of the important  texts from Greek to Syriac and the later on they translated many of the works into Arabic and other languages under Islamic rule.&lt;ref name="history natural philosophy"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major line of transmission for the development of  which provided much of the activity during the early medieval period. In the later medieval period, Europeans recovered some ancient knowledge by translations of texts and they built their work upon the knowledge of Aristotle, , , and others works. In Europe, men like  learned  and  and argued for more experimental science. By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as  was flourishing in , which had become a new geographic center of science.
By the late Middle Ages, especially in Italy there was an influx of texts and scholars from the collapsing .  formulated a  model of the solar system unlike the  of  .  All aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries; one author who was notoriously persecuted was , who made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However the persecution began after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems" which caused great offense to him.&lt;ref name="Pope Urban VIII"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  
In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church .  and  published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.
Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "", of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing "". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as .
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative.  and  succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as , which could be confirmed by experiment and explained in mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example "" and "". But in the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing.
It is, during this period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to the pursuit of a type of knowledge, and especially knowledge of nature&#8212; coming close in meaning to the old term "".

The laws of  and the  were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework.
's  and the development of  led to the replacement of Newtonian physics with a new physics which contains two parts, that describe different types of events in nature. The extensive use of scientific innovation during the wars of this century, led to the  and widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science. More recently it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature- for example in his book '''',  said "The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, EO. 1998. ''Consilience: The unity of knowledge''. New York. Alfred A. Knopf. p334&lt;/ref&gt;  supports this view.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith J. 2011. ''What is Science?''.

Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.  Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.
The belief that all observers share a common reality is known as .  It can be contrasted with , the belief that there is no valid concept of absolute truth such that things that are true for one observer are true for all observers.  The most commonly defended form of anti-realism is , the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.&lt;ref&gt;This realization is the topic of , as recounted, for example, by  (1949, 1965) [http://www.archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. Page 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."&lt;/ref&gt;  In an idealistic world-view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.
There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is , which claims that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref&gt;"...[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''."&#8212;&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses , a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and the hence finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using  only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being &lt;ref&gt;"Bayesianism tries to understand evidence using probability theory."&#8212;&lt;/ref&gt;  and the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Empiricism has stood in contrast to , the position originally associated with , which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A significant 20th-century version of rationalism is , first defined by Austrian-British philosopher . Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Popper proposed  as the landmark of scientific theories, and  as the empirical method, to replace verifiability&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and induction by purely deductive notions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, and that this method is not specific to science: The negative method of criticism, .&lt;ref&gt;Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation'' &lt;/ref&gt; It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art &lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another approach, , colloquially termed "shut up and calculate", emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that scientific theories are black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, notions and logical structure of the theories are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see ).
 advanced the idea of , which holds that there are no useful and exception-free  governing the  or the growth of , and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself. Feyerabend advocates treating science as an  alongside others such as ,  and , and considers the dominance of science in society  and unjustified. He also contended (along with ) that the  of distinguishing science from  on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules. Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, another approach often cited in debates of  against controversial movements like "", is . Its main point is that a difference between natural and  explanations should be made, and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.&lt;ref&gt; credits  (1969) "Epistemology Naturalized" ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as , with the basic ideas of naturalism&#8212; , but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, "A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.".&lt;/ref&gt; That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to  study and  as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for  phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of these standards, , biased  and other common  are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as criteria for the dubious claims they criticize not to be true science.
A scientific theory is , and is always open to  if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly  as science accepts the concept of . The philosopher of science  sharply distinguishes truth from certainty. He writes that scientific knowledge "consists in the search for truth", but it "is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."
New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist , it may be the media's overuse of words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.&lt;ref&gt; pg 119&#8211;138&lt;/ref&gt; While there are such famous cases as the  that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments, by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.&lt;ref&gt; pg 123&lt;/ref&gt; Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt; Claims that before a specific fact "existed", it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community.  (1980) "A view of scientific thought" ''Science'' ccvii (7 Mar 1980) 1065-66 states "[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. "&lt;/ref&gt; For example, , , , and  still bear the name "theory" even though, in practice, they are considered ual.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher  adds that, although the best definition for "" is contested, being  and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The   argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or  is fruitless&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1877), "The Fixation of Belief", Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 1&#8211;15, see &#167;IV on [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6&#8211;7].

XV, n. 4, pp. 481&#8211;99, see "Character V" on [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491].

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it avoids the . This means a scientist would not ask merely "What is ''the'' cause of...", but rather "What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. , ).&lt;ref name="Stanovich, 2007, pp 141&#8211;147"&gt; pp 141&#8211;147&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.&lt;ref name="Stanovich, 2007, pp 141&#8211;147"/&gt; For example: knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.
An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as , , or "alternative science".&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific&#8212; pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the ; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996)."Defining Pseudoscience", Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169&#8211;176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci "Science and Pseudo-science"] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title . According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

Physicist  coined the term "" in reference to pursuits that have the formal trappings of science but lack "a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;ref name='cargocultscience'&gt;[http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html Cargo Cult Science] by .

There also can be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of such debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science", research that is well-intentioned but is seen as incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term "" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id="COPE1999PDF"&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken as early as 1000 years ago, with , '''', through Bacon (1605), and  (1839&#8211;1914), who note that a  will then spring up to address these points of uncertainty.  The methods of  into a problem have been known for thousands of years,&lt;ref&gt;In mathematics, 's '''' demonstrates that it is possible to know logical propositions, such as the , and even to prove them, as cited by  &lt;/ref&gt; and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of s, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.

The  seeks to explain the events of  in a  way.&lt;ref&gt;: "The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!" ''(Author's punctuation)''&lt;/ref&gt; An explanatory  or  is put forward, as explanation, using principles such as  (also known as "") and are generally expected to seek &#8212;fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This new explanation is used to make  predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.&lt;ref&gt;: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&#8212; each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that ... distinguished them from non-scientists."&lt;/ref&gt; This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish  (to avoid the ). 
When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded. If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a . This is a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a  based on observed phenomena. This is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested. 
While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This can be achieved by careful , transparency, and a thorough  process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (namely the ).&lt;ref name=backer&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting , as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. , , ,  and , for example, are all essential to . Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including "pure" areas such as  and .
, which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.

According to the , computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering], SIAM Working Group on CSE Education. Retrieved 2008-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical s and s are obtained by  derivations which presume atic systems, rather than the combination of  observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the . In general, mathematics is classified as , while natural and social sciences are classified as  sciences.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Although some scientific research is  into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of . This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when, allegedly in response to the question "what is the ''use'' of basic research?" he responded "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's  did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our  is not troubled by red light would lead  teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In a nutshell: Basic research is the search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to .
Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.&lt;ref name=simonton2013&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.&lt;ref name=simonton2013/&gt;
Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing, but often take time to have that effect. For example:

The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant.
Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: s, which study natural phenomena (including ), and s, which study  and . These groupings are  sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable  and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions. There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences, such as  and . Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own  and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;See: &lt;/ref&gt;

It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using  rather than empirical methods. The formal sciences, which also include  and , are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of , , and , both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).

International scientific organizations, such as the , have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include, the  in the , the  in Argentina, the  of many nations,  in Australia,  in France,  and  in Germany, and in Spain, .
An enormous range of  is published.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, '''' followed by the '''', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. As of 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a . Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.
s such as '''', '''', and '''' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the  genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.
Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as  or, more specifically, , include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the .&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Science is largely a male-dominated field, with notable exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Women in science have included:

There is evidence suggesting that this is a product of stereotypes (e.g. science as "manly") as well as .&lt;ref&gt; (2005).

Those who are a part of the scientific community find it difficult to break the "glass ceiling" which thus limits how far they can advance within the field. The barrier between work and home has also been an obstacle that women have had to overcome to succeed in the sciences. The achievements of women in science are attributed to their defiance of traditional status of being a laborer within the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Spanier, From Molecules to Brains, Normal Science Supports Sexist Beliefs About Differences, The Gender and Science Reader ( New York: Routledge 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;
Feminist authors and leaders who hail from various educational backgrounds such as , , , and &lt;ref&gt;The Gender and Science Reader&lt;/ref&gt; have published many works interpreting and critiquing science from a feminist perspective. Some criticisms include the gendered metaphors in science, the lack of representation of females in the sciences, how science is used to back up the ideals of patriarchy, and sex/gender dichotomies.  as a sub-genre of  or  are available as areas of study in many universities as a method of activism to promote and encourage awareness of social issues as well as promoting women and intersex individuals to contribute more to the sciences.
Although it has been difficult for women to break into the field of science as credible contributors, many new discoveries have been a result of work by female scientists. Some of the most famous females in the field include , who made discoveries relating to radioactivity, , who worked with x-ray diffraction, , who was the first woman to be paid for her scientific work and , who is currently the world's foremost primatologist.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Zielinski, Ten Historic Female Scientists You Should Know, web.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Ten-Historic-Female-Scientists-You-Should-Know.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These women helped establish a place for women in a heavily male dominated field.&lt;ref name="Londa Schiebinger 1999"/&gt;

Science policy is an area of  concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including , often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.  Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.  Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.  In accordance with  being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.
  has influenced the funding of  and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the , who inspired the study of logic during the period of the , and the study of defensive fortifications during the  in China. In , governmental approval of  in the 17th century recognized a  which exists to this day.  The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the , the , and State funding of universities of their respective nations.  Public policy can directly affect the funding of , intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. , director of the office of scientific research and development for the United States government, the forerunner of the , wrote in July 1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government" &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 research is often funded through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most  is between 1.5% and 3% of .&lt;ref name="OECD2008"&gt; 50.8KB&lt;/ref&gt;  In the , around two-thirds of  in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by  and government.  The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in  and . Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. ) government provides the bulk of the funds for .  In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "" ideas or technologies (such as ).
The  face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a  may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even s who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by s. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the  frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in  include the controversy over the  , and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister,  for revealing the high probability that  farmed eggs were contaminated with ''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm "1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim"], "On This Day," BBC News, December 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
, , and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas.&lt;ref name=DoubtIs&gt; The memo reads "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HorganReview&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/18horgan.html?pagewanted=all "'THE REPUBLICAN WAR ON SCIENCE,' BY CHRIS MOONEY", Political Science, Review by JOHN HORGAN, Published: December 18 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCAMs&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219.x/abstract William R.
