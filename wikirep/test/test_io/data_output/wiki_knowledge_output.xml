'''Rain''' is liquid [[water]] in the form of [[droplet]]s that have [[condensation|condensed]] from [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[water vapor]] and then [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitated]]—that is, become heavy enough to fall under [[gravity]]. Rain is a major component of the [[water cycle]] and is responsible for depositing most of the [[fresh water]] on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of [[ecosystem]], as well as water for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plants]] and crop [[irrigation]].

The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as [[weather fronts]]. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from [[convection|convective]] clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as [[cumulonimbus]] (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow [[rainbands]]. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where [[upslope flow]] is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the [[terrain]] at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the [[air mass]]. The movement of the [[monsoon trough]], or [[intertropical convergence zone]], brings [[wet season|rainy seasons]] to [[savannah]] [[clime]]s.

The [[urban heat island]] effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. [[Global warming]] is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern [[North America]] and drier conditions in the tropics.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is {{convert|715|mm|in}}, but over the whole Earth it is much higher at {{convert|990|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetguide.net/book/chapter_2/water_cycle.html |title=The Water Cycle |publisher=Planetguide.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate]] classification systems such as the [[Köppen climate classification]] system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. Rainfall is measured using [[rain gauge]]s. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by [[weather radar]].

Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of [[methane]], [[neon]], [[sulfuric acid]] or even [[iron]] rather than water.

==Formation==

===Water-saturated air===
Air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the ''mixing ratio'', is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kempler|year=2009|url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/atmospheric_water_vapor_or_humidity.shtml|title=Parameter information page|publisher=[[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]|accessdate=2008-12-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071126083414/http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/atmospheric_water_vapor_or_humidity.shtml |archivedate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~stoeling/WH-Ch03.pdf| page=80|accessdate=2010-01-30|date=2005-09-12|author=Mark Stoelinga|title=Atmospheric Thermodynamics|publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as [[relative humidity]]; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=relative+humidity&amp;submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|accessdate=2010-01-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|title=Relative Humidity}}&lt;/ref&gt; How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%&amp;nbsp;relative humidity) and forms into a [[cloud]] (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cloud1|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|accessdate=2010-01-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|title=Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt; depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The [[dew point]] is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command|year=2007|url=http://www.navmetoccom.navy.mil/pao/Educate/WeatherTalk2/indexatmosp.htm|title=Atmospheric Moisture|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. [[Adiabatic lapse rate#Dry adiabatic lapse rate|Adiabatic cooling]] occurs when air rises and expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=adiabatic-process1|title=Adiabatic Process|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air can rise due to [[convection]], large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain ([[orographic lift]]). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TE Technology, Inc|year=2009|url=http://www.tetech.com/Cold-Plate-Coolers.html|title=Peltier Cold Plate|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of [[Thermal radiation|infrared radiation]], either by the air or by the surface underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search|title=Radiational cooling|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its [[wet-bulb temperature]], or until it reaches saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Fovell|year=2004|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf|title=Approaches to saturation|publisher=[[UCLA|University of California in Los Angelese]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalescence===
[[File:Raindrops sizes.svg|alt=Diagram showing that very small rain drops are almost spherical in shape. As drops become larger, they become flattened on the bottom, like a hamburger bun. Very large rain drops are split into smaller ones by air resistance which makes them increasingly unstable.|thumb|The shape of rain drops depend upon their size]]
[[Coalescence (meteorology)|Coalescence]] occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets. Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=warm-rain-process1|title=Warm Rain Process|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Sirvatka|year=2003|url=http://weather.cod.edu/sirvatka/bergeron.html|title=Cloud Physics: Collision/Coalescence; The Bergeron Process|publisher=[[College of DuPage]]|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raindrops have sizes ranging from {{convert|0.1|to|9|mm|in}} mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like [[hamburger]] buns; very large ones are shaped like [[parachute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bad Meteorology: Raindrops are shaped like teardrops. |url = http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadRain.html |author = Alistair B. Fraser |accessdate = 2008-04-07|date=2003-01-15|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2009|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html|title=Are raindrops tear shaped?|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over [[Brazil]] and the [[Marshall Islands]] in 2004&amp;nbsp;— some of them were as large as {{convert|10|mm|in}}. The large size is explained by condensation on large [[smoke]] particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Monster raindrops delight experts | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3898305.stm | author = Paul Rincon |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Company]]|date=2004-07-16|accessdate = 2009-11-30

Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=J .

==Causes==

===Frontal activity===
{{Main|Weather fronts}}
Stratiform (a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic systems]] (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of [[cold front]]s and near and poleward of surface [[warm front]]s. Similar ascent is seen around [[tropical cyclone]]s outside of the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]], and in comma-head precipitation patterns around [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geerts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Geerts|year=2002|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/con_str.html|title=Convective and stratiform rainfall in the tropics|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=2006|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as [[ice pellets]] and [[snow]], is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/nwp/pcu3/cases/eta_05Dec02_ptype/page4.htm|title=Precipitation Type Forecasts in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states|author=MetEd|date=2003-03-14|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hail]] becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds {{convert|11000|ft|m}} above ground level.&lt;ref name=&quot;mesoanal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/resource/soo/MesoAnalyst.htm|title=Meso-Analyst Severe Weather Guide|date=2003-01-16|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]|unused_data=Pete Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convection===
[[File:Konvektionsregen.jpg|alt=Diagram showing that as moist air becomes heated more than its surroundings, it moves upward, resulting in brief rain showers.|thumb|right|Convective precipitation]]
[[File:Steigungsregen.jpg|alt=Diagram showing how moist air over the ocean rises and flows over the land, causing cooling and rain as it hits mountain ridges.|thumb|right|Orographic precipitation]]

[[Convection rain|Convective rain]], or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., [[cumulonimbus]] or [[cumulus congestus]]. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the [[tropics]] appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geerts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert Houze |year=1997 |month=October |title=Stratiform Precipitation in Regions of Convection: A Meteorological Paradox? |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=78 |issue=10 |page=2179 |accessdate= 2007-11-27 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078&lt;2179:SPIROC&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0477|bibcode = 1997BAMS...78.2179H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graupel]] and [[hail]] indicate convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=graupel&amp;submit=Search|title=Graupel|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as [[cold front]]s, [[squall line]]s, and warm fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toby N.

===Orographic effects===
{{Main|Orographic lift|Precipitation types (meteorology)|United States rainfall climatology}}

Orographic precipitation occurs on the [[windward]] side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the [[trade wind]]s), a more moist [[climate]] usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MT&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|Global warming|Urban heat island}}
The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms [[cloud condensation nuclei]], leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' [[Eastern Seaboard]], the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1998-08-06|author= R.

Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1&amp;nbsp;percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1&amp;nbsp;percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentpsc.html|title=Precipitation and Storm Changes|author=Climate Change Division|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a cyclone occludes, a '''tr'''ough '''o'''f '''w'''arm air '''al'''oft, or &quot;trowal&quot; for short, will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.&lt;ref name=&quot;TROW&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Acidity===
[[File:Origins of acid rain.svg|thumb|right]]
{{See also|Acid rain}}
The pH of rain varies, especially due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es00166a003|title=Effect of storm type on rainwater composition in southeastern North Carolina|author=Joan D. Willey|publisher=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=1988-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raising the pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es060638w?prevSearch=%255Bauthor%253A%2BWilley%252C%2BJoan%2BD.%255D&amp;searchHistoryKey=|title=Changing Chemical Composition of Precipitation in Wilmington, North Carolina, U.S.A.: Implications for the Continental U.S.A|author=Joan D.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rain forest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], [[polar ice cap]], and desert.

[[File:250mm Rain Gauge.jpg|thumb|upright|left|125 px|Standard rain gauge]]

{{See also|Rain gauge|Disdrometer|Snow gauge}}

Rain is measured in units of length per unit time, typically in millimeters per hour,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or in countries where [[imperial units]] are more common, inches per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/docs/fem/Chapter 5 - Principal Hazards in U.S.doc |title=Chapter 5 - Principal Hazards in U.S.doc|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;length&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;depth&quot; being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat, horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time, typically an hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99115.htm Rain gauge and cubic inches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e05.htm |title=FAO.org |publisher=FAO.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Office, Northern Indiana|year=2009|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/coop/8inch.php|title=8 Inch Non-Recording Standard Rain Gauge|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner cylinder is filled by {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to {{convert|0.25|mm|in|abbr=on}} resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate {{convert|0.25|mm|in|abbr=on}} markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Lehmann|year=2009|url=http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/CAL/2000_reminders-4thQ.htm|title=10/00|publisher=Central Analytical Laboratory|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|year=2009|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|title=Glossary: W|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with.

Radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is,
:&lt;math&gt; Z = A R^b &lt;/math&gt;,

where Z represents the radar reflectivity, R represents the rainfall rate, and A and b are constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/2115/1/pdfthesis.pdf|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|author=Eric Chay Ware|title=Corrections to Radar-Estimated Precipitation Using Observed Rain Gauge Data: A Thesis|date=August 2005|page=1|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive [[microwave]] instruments aboard [[polar orbit]]ing as well as [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[weather satellite]]s to indirectly measure rainfall rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/meetings/melbourne/papers/Mngadi.pdf|title=Southern Africa Satellite Derived Rainfall Estimates Validation|author=Pearl Mngadi, Petrus JM Visser, and Elizabeth Ebert|page=1|publisher=International Precipitation Working Group|date=October 2006|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.

The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term ''1 in 100&amp;nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1&amp;nbsp;percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10&amp;nbsp;year event.

==Impact==

===Effect on agriculture===
[[File:Heavy Rains in Southern Japan.gif|thumb|Rainfall estimates for southern [[Japan]] and the surrounding region from July 20–27, 2009.]]
Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on [[agriculture]]. All [[plant]]s need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy [[plant]]s, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to [[crops]]. [[Drought]] can kill crops and increase erosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml|title=Living With Drought|author=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2010|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while overly wet weather can cause harmful [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agnewsarchive.tamu.edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/Jun0607a.htm|title=Texas Crop and Weather|date=2007-06-06|author=Robert Burns|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]]|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain [[cactus|cacti]] require small amounts of water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/researchoncacti/|title=Mauseth Research: Cacti|author=James D. Mauseth|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.

In areas with wet and dry seasons, [[soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS&quot;/&gt; Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Roberto Frisancho]] (1993).

&lt;/ref&gt; making it the world's driest inhabited [[continent]]. In South America, the [[Andes]] mountain range blocks [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andes&quot;/&gt; The drier areas of the United States are regions where the [[Sonoran desert]] overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;USatl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-09-17|author=NationalAtlas.gov|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/precipitation.html|title=Precipitation of the Individual States and of the Conterminous States|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar desert===
{{main|Polar desert|Polar climate}}
Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain can not fall. As a result, very cold climates see very little rainfall and are often known as [[polar desert]]s. A common biome in this area is the [[tundra]] which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. [[Ice caps]] see no rain at all, making [[Antarctica]] the world's driest continent.

===Rainforests===
{{see also|Rainforest}}
Rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall. Both [[Tropical rainforest|tropical]] and [[Temperate rainforest|temperate]] rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the [[equator]]. Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are often found in other areas.

Around 40-75% of all biotic life is found in rainforests. Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover.

===Monsoons===
{{See also|Monsoon|Monsoon trough}}
The equatorial region near the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), or monsoon trough, is the wettest portion of the world's continents. Annually, the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August, then moves back southward into the [[Southern Hemisphere]] by February and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jisao.washington.edu/data/ud/africa/|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|title=Africa Rainfall Climatology|author=Todd Mitchell|date=October 2001|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Asia, rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the [[Indian Ocean]] into the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://airsea-www.jpl.nasa.gov/publication/paper/CARRS-ms5.pdf|title=Monsoon, Orography, and Human Influence on Asian Rainfall|journal=Proceedings of the First International Symposium in Cloud-prone &amp; Rainy Areas Remote Sensing (CARRS), Chinese University of Hong Kong|author=W. Timothy Liu, Xiaosu Xie, and Wenqing Tang|publisher=[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|year=2006|accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]] in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure (a [[thermal low]]) over the warmest part of Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCFMRF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=National Centre for Medium Range Forecasting|date=2004-10-23|url=http://www.ncmrwf.gov.in/Chapter-II.pdf|title=Chapter-II Monsoon-2004: Onset, Advancement and Circulation Features|publisher=India Ministry of Earth Sciences|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=1999-08-11|url=http://www.abc.net.au/storm/monsoon/print.htm|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but weaker, monsoon circulations are present over [[North America]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David J.
