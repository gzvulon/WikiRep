Earlier this month, justice secretary Chris Grayling said convicted criminals could be barred from claiming legal aid to fund "unnecessary" complaints about the prison system. He said he was "appalled" at taxpayers' money being used by prisoners to bring "unnecessary legal cases" that could be dealt with by the prison service's internal complaints system. He said the changes would save £4m a year and cut the number of cases by 11,000.
But lawyers question his figures. Matthew Evans, managing solicitor for the Prisoners' Advice Service (PAS), which provides free prison law advice, says legal aid for almost all prisoner complaints was removed by the Labour government in 2010. Lawyers wishing to take such cases must now get prior authority from the Legal Aid Agency, something it has granted for only 20 or so cases in the last three years.
And internal complaints procedures can fail prisoners. PAS recently acted for a prisoner who had been upgraded to category B status after being falsely accused of involvement in a near riot. The move would have delayed his release by years. On appeal, he found his paperwork contained a litany of errors: it stated he had been a cat C prisoner (he was cat D); was in prison for murder (it was GBH); and had been moved from open conditions after six days for behaviour issues (he had been in an open prison for two years without incident and returned to closed conditions to be assessed for a course). PAS successfully sought a judicial view to put these glaring errors right.
I asked Grayling how many prisoners were granted legal aid to pursue complaints in 2012 and how he calculated there would be savings of £4m a year and 11,000 fewer cases? He replied that he was "appalled" – again – that "taxpayers pay millions every year supplying lawyers for prisoners" and the "vast majority of complaints should be dealt with by the prison service". He failed to answer any of my specific questions.
