Jamie Kirk Hahn, a 29-year-old Democratic campaign strategist, died Wednesday as a result of stab wounds suffered Monday at her home in Raleigh, N.C., the Raleigh News & Observer reports.

Hahn and her husband, Nation Richard Hahn, 27, were at their house on Monday along with Jonathan Wayne Broyhill, 31, when the stabbing took place, according to earlier reports. Both of the Hahns were treated at the hospital for their injuries, and the husband was later released.

Broyhill, who was the best man at the couple's wedding and is a frequent presence on their social media profiles, was arrested for the attack and initially charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Police said Broyhill, who was also being treated at the hospital for injuries, will now be charged with murder, according to WRAL.

The news of Jamie Hahn's injury and death has rocked the North Carolina political world. Hahn, who most recently founded the firm Sky Blue Strategies, had worked for high-profile Democratic candidates across the state, including then-Rep. Brad Miller (D-N.C.).

Nation Hahn is also a Democratic strategist known in Raleigh political circles. Broyhill reportedly worked with Jamie Hahn at Sky Blue Strategies and was a former staffer for Miller, as well as other political candidates.

On Wednesday, Jamie Hahn's family released a statement on her death.

"We lost a beautiful and loving wife, daughter and friend," they said. "We all lost a pure and brave spirit. She had a gift for bringing us together -- black and white, young and old, gay and straight. She challenged us to work together for a better world."

Nation Hahn later took to Twitter to thank people for their support and address the tragedy:
