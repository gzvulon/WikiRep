'''Rain''' is liquid [[water]] in the form of [[droplet]]s that have [[condensation|condensed]] from [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[water vapor]] and then [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitated]]—that is, become heavy enough to fall under [[gravity]]. Rain is a major component of the [[water cycle]] and is responsible for depositing most of the [[fresh water]] on the Earth. It provides suitable conditions for many types of [[ecosystem]], as well as water for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power plants]] and crop [[irrigation]].

The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as [[weather fronts]]. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from [[convection|convective]] clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as [[cumulonimbus]] (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow [[rainbands]]. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where [[upslope flow]] is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the [[terrain]] at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the [[air mass]]. The movement of the [[monsoon trough]], or [[intertropical convergence zone]], brings [[wet season|rainy seasons]] to [[savannah]] [[clime]]s.

The [[urban heat island]] effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities. [[Global warming]] is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern [[North America]] and drier conditions in the tropics.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Antarctica is the driest continent. The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is {{convert|715|mm|in}}, but over the whole Earth it is much higher at {{convert|990|mm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetguide.net/book/chapter_2/water_cycle.html |title=The Water Cycle |publisher=Planetguide.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate]] classification systems such as the [[Köppen climate classification]] system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes. Rainfall is measured using [[rain gauge]]s. Rainfall amounts can be estimated by [[weather radar]].

Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of [[methane]], [[neon]], [[sulfuric acid]] or even [[iron]] rather than water.

==Formation==

===Water-saturated air===
Air contains water vapor and the amount of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the ''mixing ratio'', is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kempler|year=2009|url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/atmospheric_water_vapor_or_humidity.shtml|title=Parameter information page|publisher=[[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]|accessdate=2008-12-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071126083414/http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/atmospheric_water_vapor_or_humidity.shtml |archivedate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~stoeling/WH-Ch03.pdf| page=80|accessdate=2010-01-30|date=2005-09-12|author=Mark Stoelinga|title=Atmospheric Thermodynamics|publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as [[relative humidity]]; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=relative+humidity&amp;submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|accessdate=2010-01-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|title=Relative Humidity}}&lt;/ref&gt; How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%&amp;nbsp;relative humidity) and forms into a [[cloud]] (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=cloud1|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|accessdate=2010-01-29|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|title=Cloud}}&lt;/ref&gt; depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The [[dew point]] is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command|year=2007|url=http://www.navmetoccom.navy.mil/pao/Educate/WeatherTalk2/indexatmosp.htm|title=Atmospheric Moisture|publisher=[[United States Navy]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four main mechanisms for cooling the air to its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. [[Adiabatic lapse rate#Dry adiabatic lapse rate|Adiabatic cooling]] occurs when air rises and expands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=adiabatic-process1|title=Adiabatic Process|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air can rise due to [[convection]], large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain ([[orographic lift]]). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TE Technology, Inc|year=2009|url=http://www.tetech.com/Cold-Plate-Coolers.html|title=Peltier Cold Plate|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of [[Thermal radiation|infrared radiation]], either by the air or by the surface underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=radiational+cooling&amp;submit=Search|title=Radiational cooling|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture is added to the air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its [[wet-bulb temperature]], or until it reaches saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Fovell|year=2004|url=http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~fovell/AS3downloads/saturation.pdf|title=Approaches to saturation|publisher=[[UCLA|University of California in Los Angelese]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coalescence===
[[File:Raindrops sizes.svg|alt=Diagram showing that very small rain drops are almost spherical in shape. As drops become larger, they become flattened on the bottom, like a hamburger bun. Very large rain drops are split into smaller ones by air resistance which makes them increasingly unstable.|thumb|The shape of rain drops depend upon their size]]
[[Coalescence (meteorology)|Coalescence]] occurs when water droplets fuse to create larger water droplets. Air resistance typically causes the water droplets in a cloud to remain stationary. When air turbulence occurs, water droplets collide, producing larger droplets. As these larger water droplets descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens most often in clouds above freezing, and is also known as the warm rain process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=warm-rain-process1|title=Warm Rain Process|accessdate=2010-01-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring water droplets. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Sirvatka|year=2003|url=http://weather.cod.edu/sirvatka/bergeron.html|title=Cloud Physics: Collision/Coalescence; The Bergeron Process|publisher=[[College of DuPage]]|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raindrops have sizes ranging from {{convert|0.1|to|9|mm|in}} mean diameter, above which they tend to break up. Smaller drops are called cloud droplets, and their shape is spherical. As a raindrop increases in size, its shape becomes more oblate, with its largest cross-section facing the oncoming airflow. Large rain drops become increasingly flattened on the bottom, like [[hamburger]] buns; very large ones are shaped like [[parachute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bad Meteorology: Raindrops are shaped like teardrops. |url = http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadRain.html |author = Alistair B. Fraser |accessdate = 2008-04-07|date=2003-01-15|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, their shape does not resemble a teardrop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2009|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html|title=Are raindrops tear shaped?|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest raindrops on Earth were recorded over [[Brazil]] and the [[Marshall Islands]] in 2004&amp;nbsp;— some of them were as large as {{convert|10|mm|in}}. The large size is explained by condensation on large [[smoke]] particles or by collisions between drops in small regions with particularly high content of liquid water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Monster raindrops delight experts | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3898305.stm | author = Paul Rincon |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Company]]|date=2004-07-16|accessdate = 2009-11-30

Intensity and duration of rainfall are usually inversely related, i.e., high intensity storms are likely to be of short duration and low intensity storms can have a long duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=J .

==Causes==

===Frontal activity===
{{Main|Weather fronts}}
Stratiform (a broad shield of precipitation with a relatively similar intensity) and dynamic precipitation (convective precipitation which is showery in nature with large changes in intensity over short distances) occur as a consequence of slow ascent of air in [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic systems]] (on the order of cm/s), such as in the vicinity of [[cold front]]s and near and poleward of surface [[warm front]]s. Similar ascent is seen around [[tropical cyclone]]s outside of the [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]], and in comma-head precipitation patterns around [[mid-latitude cyclone]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geerts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Geerts|year=2002|url=http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap10/con_str.html|title=Convective and stratiform rainfall in the tropics|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|accessdate=2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of weather can be found along an occluded front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low-pressure areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=David Roth|title=Unified Surface Analysis Manual|year=2006|accessdate=2006-10-22|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|url= http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/UASfcManualVersion1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; What separates rainfall from other precipitation types, such as [[ice pellets]] and [[snow]], is the presence of a thick layer of air aloft which is above the melting point of water, which melts the frozen precipitation well before it reaches the ground. If there is a shallow near surface layer that is below freezing, freezing rain (rain which freezes on contact with surfaces in subfreezing environments) will result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/nwp/pcu3/cases/eta_05Dec02_ptype/page4.htm|title=Precipitation Type Forecasts in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states|author=MetEd|date=2003-03-14|accessdate=2010-01-30|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hail]] becomes an increasingly infrequent occurrence when the freezing level within the atmosphere exceeds {{convert|11000|ft|m}} above ground level.&lt;ref name=&quot;mesoanal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meted.ucar.edu/resource/soo/MesoAnalyst.htm|title=Meso-Analyst Severe Weather Guide|date=2003-01-16|accessdate=2009-07-16|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]|unused_data=Pete Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convection===
[[File:Konvektionsregen.jpg|alt=Diagram showing that as moist air becomes heated more than its surroundings, it moves upward, resulting in brief rain showers.|thumb|right|Convective precipitation]]
[[File:Steigungsregen.jpg|alt=Diagram showing how moist air over the ocean rises and flows over the land, causing cooling and rain as it hits mountain ridges.|thumb|right|Orographic precipitation]]

[[Convection rain|Convective rain]], or showery precipitation, occurs from convective clouds, e.g., [[cumulonimbus]] or [[cumulus congestus]]. It falls as showers with rapidly changing intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain area for a relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the [[tropics]] appears to be convective; however, it has been suggested that stratiform precipitation also occurs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geerts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert Houze |year=1997 |month=October |title=Stratiform Precipitation in Regions of Convection: A Meteorological Paradox? |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |volume=78 |issue=10 |page=2179 |accessdate= 2007-11-27 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1997)078&lt;2179:SPIROC&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0477|bibcode = 1997BAMS...78.2179H }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graupel]] and [[hail]] indicate convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Glossary of Meteorology|year=2009|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=graupel&amp;submit=Search|title=Graupel|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as [[cold front]]s, [[squall line]]s, and warm fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Toby N.

===Orographic effects===
{{Main|Orographic lift|Precipitation types (meteorology)|United States rainfall climatology}}

Orographic precipitation occurs on the [[windward]] side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in [[Adiabatic lapse rate|adiabatic]] cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the [[trade wind]]s), a more moist [[climate]] usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the [[leeward]] or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see [[katabatic wind]]) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a [[rain shadow]] is observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MT&quot;/&gt;

{{See also|Global warming|Urban heat island}}
The fine particulate matter produced by car exhaust and other human sources of pollution forms [[cloud condensation nuclei]], leads to the production of clouds and increases the likelihood of rain. As commuters and commercial traffic cause pollution to build up over the course of the week, the likelihood of rain increases: it peaks by Saturday, after five days of weekday pollution has been built up. In heavily populated areas that are near the coast, such as the United States' [[Eastern Seaboard]], the effect can be dramatic: there is a 22% higher chance of rain on Saturdays than on Mondays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1998-08-06|author= R.

Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which can lead to more precipitation. Precipitation generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 through 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s. Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time. Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter. The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier. There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics. Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation and/or more evaporation). Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1&amp;nbsp;percent since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6 percent per century) and the South (11.1&amp;nbsp;percent). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25&amp;nbsp;percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/recentpsc.html|title=Precipitation and Storm Changes|author=Climate Change Division|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a cyclone occludes, a '''tr'''ough '''o'''f '''w'''arm air '''al'''oft, or &quot;trowal&quot; for short, will be caused by strong southerly winds on its eastern periphery rotating aloft around its northeast, and ultimately northwestern, periphery (also known as the warm conveyor belt), forcing a surface trough to continue into the cold sector on a similar curve to the occluded front. The trowal creates the portion of an occluded cyclone known as its comma head, due to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]]-like shape of the mid-tropospheric cloudiness that accompanies the feature. It can also be the focus of locally heavy precipitation, with thunderstorms possible if the atmosphere along the trowal is unstable enough for convection.&lt;ref name=&quot;TROW&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Acidity===
[[File:Origins of acid rain.svg|thumb|right]]
{{See also|Acid rain}}
The pH of rain varies, especially due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that is derived from the Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es00166a003|title=Effect of storm type on rainwater composition in southeastern North Carolina|author=Joan D. Willey|publisher=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=1988-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which may be due to the significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raising the pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es060638w?prevSearch=%255Bauthor%253A%2BWilley%252C%2BJoan%2BD.%255D&amp;searchHistoryKey=|title=Changing Chemical Composition of Precipitation in Wilmington, North Carolina, U.S.A.: Implications for the Continental U.S.A|author=Joan D.

{{Main|Köppen climate classification}}

The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as [[rain forest]], [[monsoon]], [[tropical savanna]], [[humid subtropical]], [[humid continental]], [[oceanic climate]], [[Mediterranean climate]], [[steppe]], [[subarctic climate]], [[tundra]], [[polar ice cap]], and desert.

[[File:250mm Rain Gauge.jpg|thumb|upright|left|125 px|Standard rain gauge]]

{{See also|Rain gauge|Disdrometer|Snow gauge}}

Rain is measured in units of length per unit time, typically in millimeters per hour,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/IMOP/publications/CIMO-Guide/CIMO%20Guide%207th%20Edition,%202008/Part%20I/Chapter%206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or in countries where [[imperial units]] are more common, inches per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/docs/fem/Chapter 5 - Principal Hazards in U.S.doc |title=Chapter 5 - Principal Hazards in U.S.doc|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;length&quot;, or more accurately, &quot;depth&quot; being measured is the depth of rain water that would accumulate on a flat, horizontal and impermeable surface during a given amount of time, typically an hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen99/gen99115.htm Rain gauge and cubic inches&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One millimeter of rainfall is the equivalent of one liter of water per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e05.htm |title=FAO.org |publisher=FAO.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard way of measuring rainfall or snowfall is the standard rain gauge, which can be found in 100-mm (4-in) plastic and 200-mm (8-in) metal varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]] Office, Northern Indiana|year=2009|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/iwx/program_areas/coop/8inch.php|title=8 Inch Non-Recording Standard Rain Gauge|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner cylinder is filled by {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain, with overflow flowing into the outer cylinder. Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to {{convert|0.25|mm|in|abbr=on}} resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate {{convert|0.25|mm|in|abbr=on}} markings. After the inner cylinder is filled, the amount inside it is discarded, then filled with the remaining rainfall in the outer cylinder until all the fluid in the outer cylinder is gone, adding to the overall total until the outer cylinder is empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Lehmann|year=2009|url=http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/CAL/2000_reminders-4thQ.htm|title=10/00|publisher=Central Analytical Laboratory|accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of gauges include the popular wedge gauge (the cheapest rain gauge and most fragile), the tipping bucket rain gauge, and the weighing rain gauge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[National Weather Service]]|year=2009|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=w|title=Glossary: W|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those looking to measure rainfall the most inexpensively, a can that is cylindrical with straight sides will act as a rain gauge if left out in the open, but its accuracy will depend on what ruler is used to measure the rain with.

Radar-derived rainfall estimates compliment surface station data which can be used for calibration. To produce radar accumulations, rain rates over a point are estimated by using the value of reflectivity data at individual grid points. A radar equation is then used, which is,
:&lt;math&gt; Z = A R^b &lt;/math&gt;,

where Z represents the radar reflectivity, R represents the rainfall rate, and A and b are constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/2115/1/pdfthesis.pdf|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|author=Eric Chay Ware|title=Corrections to Radar-Estimated Precipitation Using Observed Rain Gauge Data: A Thesis|date=August 2005|page=1|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite derived rainfall estimates use passive [[microwave]] instruments aboard [[polar orbit]]ing as well as [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[weather satellite]]s to indirectly measure rainfall rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isac.cnr.it/~ipwg/meetings/melbourne/papers/Mngadi.pdf|title=Southern Africa Satellite Derived Rainfall Estimates Validation|author=Pearl Mngadi, Petrus JM Visser, and Elizabeth Ebert|page=1|publisher=International Precipitation Working Group|date=October 2006|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one wants an accumulated rainfall over a time period, one has to add up all the accumulations from each grid box within the images during that time.

The rainfall will be greater and the flooding will be worse than the worst storm expected in any single year. The term ''1 in 100&amp;nbsp;year storm'' describes a rainfall event which is extremely rare and which will occur with a likelihood of only once in a century, so has a 1&amp;nbsp;percent likelihood in any given year. The rainfall will be extreme and flooding to be worse than a 1 in 10&amp;nbsp;year event.

==Impact==

===Effect on agriculture===
[[File:Heavy Rains in Southern Japan.gif|thumb|Rainfall estimates for southern [[Japan]] and the surrounding region from July 20–27, 2009.]]
Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on [[agriculture]]. All [[plant]]s need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy [[plant]]s, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to [[crops]]. [[Drought]] can kill crops and increase erosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/livedrought.shtml|title=Living With Drought|author=[[Bureau of Meteorology]]|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2010|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while overly wet weather can cause harmful [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agnewsarchive.tamu.edu/dailynews/stories/CROP/Jun0607a.htm|title=Texas Crop and Weather|date=2007-06-06|author=Robert Burns|publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]]|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain [[cactus|cacti]] require small amounts of water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/mauseth/researchoncacti/|title=Mauseth Research: Cacti|author=James D. Mauseth|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|date=2006-07-07|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.

In areas with wet and dry seasons, [[soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.&lt;ref name=&quot;JS&quot;/&gt; Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Roberto Frisancho]] (1993).

&lt;/ref&gt; making it the world's driest inhabited [[continent]]. In South America, the [[Andes]] mountain range blocks [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andes&quot;/&gt; The drier areas of the United States are regions where the [[Sonoran desert]] overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;USatl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-09-17|author=NationalAtlas.gov|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/printable/precipitation.html|title=Precipitation of the Individual States and of the Conterminous States|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar desert===
{{main|Polar desert|Polar climate}}
Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain can not fall. As a result, very cold climates see very little rainfall and are often known as [[polar desert]]s. A common biome in this area is the [[tundra]] which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. [[Ice caps]] see no rain at all, making [[Antarctica]] the world's driest continent.

===Rainforests===
{{see also|Rainforest}}
Rainforests are areas of the world with very high rainfall. Both [[Tropical rainforest|tropical]] and [[Temperate rainforest|temperate]] rainforests exist. Tropical rainforests occupy a large band of the planet mostly along the [[equator]]. Most temperate rainforests are located on mountainous west coasts between 45 and 55 degrees latitude, but they are often found in other areas.

Around 40-75% of all biotic life is found in rainforests. Rainforests are also responsible for 28% of the world's oxygen turnover.

===Monsoons===
{{See also|Monsoon|Monsoon trough}}
The equatorial region near the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ), or monsoon trough, is the wettest portion of the world's continents. Annually, the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August, then moves back southward into the [[Southern Hemisphere]] by February and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jisao.washington.edu/data/ud/africa/|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|title=Africa Rainfall Climatology|author=Todd Mitchell|date=October 2001|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Asia, rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the [[Indian Ocean]] into the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://airsea-www.jpl.nasa.gov/publication/paper/CARRS-ms5.pdf|title=Monsoon, Orography, and Human Influence on Asian Rainfall|journal=Proceedings of the First International Symposium in Cloud-prone &amp; Rainy Areas Remote Sensing (CARRS), Chinese University of Hong Kong|author=W. Timothy Liu, Xiaosu Xie, and Wenqing Tang|publisher=[[National Aeronautic and Space Administration]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|year=2006|accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monsoon trough can reach as far north as the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]] in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure (a [[thermal low]]) over the warmest part of Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCFMRF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=National Centre for Medium Range Forecasting|date=2004-10-23|url=http://www.ncmrwf.gov.in/Chapter-II.pdf|title=Chapter-II Monsoon-2004: Onset, Advancement and Circulation Features|publisher=India Ministry of Earth Sciences|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=1999-08-11|url=http://www.abc.net.au/storm/monsoon/print.htm|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but weaker, monsoon circulations are present over [[North America]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David J.

The English word '''love''' can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure (&quot;I loved that meal&quot;) to [[interpersonal attraction]] (&quot;I love my partner&quot;). It can refer to an [[emotion]] of a strong [[affection]] and personal [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be a [[virtue]] representing human [[kindness]], [[compassion]], and affection—&quot;the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love Merriam Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; And it may describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 1956&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of interpersonal attraction, four forms of love have traditionally been distinguished, based on ancient Greek precedent: the love of kinship or [[familial love|familiarity]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''[[storge]]''), the love of [[friendship]] (''[[philia]]''), the love of sexual and/or [[romance (love)|romantic desire]] (''[[eros (concept)|eros]]''), and [[Kenosis|self-emptying]] or divine love (''[[agape]]'').&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatonicSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University |year=1980 |isbn=0-691-02010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stendhal]], in his book ''On Love'' (Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called &quot;taste-love&quot;, and love of vanity. [[Denis de Rougemont]] in his book ''Love in the Western World'' traced the story of passionate love (''l'amour-passion'') from its courtly to its romantic forms. [[Benjamin Péret]], in the introduction to his ''Anthology of Sublime Love'' (Paris, 1956), further distinguished &quot;sublime love&quot;, a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love.&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-Western traditions have also distinguished [[Religious views on love|variants or symbioses of these states]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gita&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-044918-3}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define,  compared to other emotional states.

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article On Love|url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why we love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Love sidebar}}
The word &quot;love&quot; can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often, other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on &quot;love&quot; to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for &quot;love.&quot;]] [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships.

When discussed in the abstract, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.TrueOpenLove.org/reference/AncientLovePoetry.html
|title=Ancient Love Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from [[Virgil|Virgil's]] &quot;[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]&quot; to [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[All You Need Is Love]]&quot;. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as &quot;to will the good of another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of &quot;absolute value,&quot; as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is &quot;to be delighted by the happiness of another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Love is sometimes referred to as being the &quot;international language&quot;, overriding cultural and linguistic divisions.

==Impersonal love==
A person can be said to love an object, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' &quot;love&quot; of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (September 5, 2000), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt; People can also &quot;love&quot; material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = DiscoveryHealth | first = | title = Paraphilia | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480-1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding of the nature and function of love.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas | coauthors = Amini, F., &amp; Lannon, R. | title = [[A General Theory of Love]] | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=0-375-70922-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot;&gt;
http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf Deﬁning the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot; /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including [[pheromones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], which act in a manner similar to [[amphetamine]]s, stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-03-093780-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Psychological basis===
{{further2|[[Human bonding]]}}
Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (1986). &quot;A triangular theory of love&quot;. Psychological Review 93 (2): 119–135. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 0-201-00560-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the &quot;concern for the spiritual growth of another,&quot; and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name=&quot;peck&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=0-671-25067-1 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book ''[[The Art of Loving]]'' that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the &quot;feeling&quot; of love is superficial in comparison to ones commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, ones self, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Fromm also described Love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans comparative to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[Nerve Growth Factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

===Ancient Greek===
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word &quot;love&quot; is used. For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a &quot;pure,&quot; [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as &quot;love of the soul.&quot;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as &quot;love of the body.&quot;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean &quot;love of the mind.&quot;

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot; ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—&quot;friend&quot;—and ''amicitia'', &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot; ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[File:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|&quot;Ai,&quot; the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (心, middle) inside of &quot;accept,&quot; &quot;feel,&quot; or &quot;perceive,&quot; (受) which shows a graceful emotion. It can also be interpreted as a hand offering ones heart to another hand.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]''  (&quot;benevolent love&quot;, 仁), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (愛) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. ''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (''Wo xihuan ni'', 我喜欢你) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, &quot;[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', 好きだ). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.

===Persian===
[[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] are icons of the passion and love that the [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and language present. The Persian word for love is ''eshgh'' {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, derived from the Arabic ''ishq'', however is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for 'doost dashtan' ('liking'){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Over seven centuries ago, Sa'di wrote:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The children of Adam are limbs of one body
Having been created of one essence.
When the calamity of time afflicts one limb
The other limbs cannot remain at rest.
If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others
You are not worthy to be called by the name of &quot;man&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Japanese===
[[File:Ohatu and tokubei.jpg|right|thumb|Ohatsu and Tokubei, characters of ''[[Sonezaki Shinjū]]'']]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''ai'' (愛) is passionate caring love, and a fundamental desire. It can develop towards either selfishness or selflessness and enlightenment. ''[[Amae]]'' (甘え), a Japanese word meaning &quot;indulgent dependence,&quot; is part of the child-rearing [[culture of Japan]]. Japanese mothers are expected to hug and indulge their children, and children are expected to reward their mothers by clinging and serving. Some [[sociologist]]s have suggested that Japanese social interactions in later life are modeled on the mother-child amae.

===Turkish (Shaman and Islamic)===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;aşk.&quot; ''[[Ishq|Aşk]]'' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being &quot;in love&quot; (Aşık), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for [[Turkic languages]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (eşq) and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] (ғашық).

===Abrahamic religions===

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html
|author=Pope Benedict XVI
|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for &quot;love&quot; that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as &quot;brotherly love.&quot;
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote &quot;''Love God, and do as thou wilt''.&quot;

[[File:baglione.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sacred Love Versus Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poem in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.&quot; ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, ''&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot;'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, ''&quot;Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;'' ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

Saint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, ''“I was in love with love.”'' Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as ''“jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.”'' According to Saint Augustine, to love God is ''“to attain the peace which is yours.”'' (Saint Augustine's Confessions)

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] wrote his first [[encyclical]] on &quot;[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]&quot;. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;/&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;/&gt;  This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies.  As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

====Judaism====
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Ahava'' is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as [[loving-kindness]], is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, &quot;Love your neighbor like yourself&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] &quot;with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: &quot;See life with the wife you love&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as &quot;giving without expecting to take&quot; (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or &quot;the Loving One,&quot; which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being &quot;full of loving kindness.&quot;

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or &quot;deep kindness&quot; as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God &quot;looks&quot; at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being &quot;drunk&quot; due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article On Love|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Love.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====
[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama_in_Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prem]]a''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning &quot;loving devotion to the supreme God.&quot; A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unaldulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)—two opposites .&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishna Prema&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the [[Gita Govinda]] and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God (taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya), and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination (krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya).  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
===Free love===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term '''free love''' has been used &lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement’s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. &quot;The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.&quot; Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of [[anarchism]], and reflects a [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to &quot;fulfill earthly human happiness.&quot; Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision on strongly defined gender roles, which led to the advancement of the free love movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurlock, John C 1988&quot;&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that love relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.

The term &quot;'''sex radical'''&quot; is also used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;, and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of &quot;free love&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Passet, Joanne E 2003&quot;&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago,IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also beliefs of [[Feminism]].

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[adultery]] and [[divorce]], as well as [[age of consent]], [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], [[abortion]], and sometimes [[prostitution]]; although not all free love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.

==Philosophical views==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
Philosophy of love is the field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] which attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of love. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love; asking if and how love is/can be justified; asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is; and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.

There are many different theories which attempt to [[explanation|explain]] what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

In [[botany]], a '''tree''' is a [[plant]] with an elongated stem, or [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], supporting leaves or branches.

In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only [[wood]]y plants, only plants that are usable as [[lumber]], only plants above a specified height or only [[perennial]] species. At its broadest, trees include the taller [[Arecaceae|palms]], the [[Cyatheales|tree ferns]], [[banana]]s and [[bamboo]]. 

A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and [[vascular tissue]] to carry materials from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy by [[photosynthesis]], providing the food needed by the tree for its growth and development.

Flowers and fruit may also be present, but some trees such as conifers instead have pollen cones and seed cones, and others such as tree ferns produce spores instead.

Trees tend to be long-lived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanflowerproject.com/index.php/weblog/comments/plant_size_and_longevity_rules_of_thumb/ |title=Plant Size and Longevity |author=Wandersee, James H.; Clary, Renee M. |year=2008 |work=Human Flower Project |publisher=EarthScholars Research Group |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known specimen on Earth is 115.6&amp;nbsp;m (379&amp;nbsp;ft) and they have a theoretical maximum height of 130&amp;nbsp;m (426&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/the_limits_to_tree_height_995.pdf |title=The limits to tree height |author=Koch, George W.; Sillett, Stephen C.; Jennings, Gregory M.; Davis, Stephen D. |year=2004 |work=Letters to Nature |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees have been in existence on the Earth for 370 million years. Trees are not a taxonomic group but are a number of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants and make full use of the sunlight.

Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere and store large quantities of [[carbon]] in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. [[Tropical rainforest]]s are one of the most [[Biodiversity|biodiverse]] habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered and they play a role in many of the world's [[mythology|mythologies]].

==Definition==

Although &quot;tree&quot; is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition what a tree is, neither botanically nor in common language.&lt;ref name=&quot;as.miami.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.as.miami.edu/qr/arboretum/what_is_a_tree.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Mahon James. &quot;THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY: HEIDEGGER, PERSONHOOD AND TECHNOLOGY.&quot; Comparative Philosophy 2.2 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao.org&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/t7540e/T7540E04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;www.ffgc.org/youth/images/junior_gardeners_how_to.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/bot00/bot00761.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Trees are also typically defined by height,&lt;ref&gt;https://sharepoint.cahnrs.wsu.edu/extadmin/bookshelf/Documents/Zobrist,%20Kevin%202012/Supplemental%20Materials%20for%20External%20Reviewers/OM1_WWA_NativeTrees.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/121.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gschwantner, Thomas 2009&quot;&gt;Gschwantner, Thomas, et al. &quot;Common tree definitions for national forest inventories in Europe.&quot; Silva Fennica 43.2 (2009): 303-321.&lt;/ref&gt; with smaller plants being classified as shrubs,&lt;ref name=treedictionary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treedictionary.com/ |title=Tree Biology Dictionary |author=Keslick, John A. |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the minimum height which defines a tree varies widely, from 10 m to 0.5 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gschwantner, Thomas 2009&quot;/&gt;  By these broadest definitions, large herbaceous plants such as [[papaya]] and [[banana]]s are trees, despite not being considered as trees under more rigorous definitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;as.miami.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neeff, Till, Heiner Von Luepke, and Dieter Schoene. &quot;Choosing a forest definition for the Clean Development Mechanism.&quot; Forests and Climate Change Working Paper (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.umass.edu/psoil370/Syllabus-files/Agroforestry_Principles.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tesfaye, B. 2008 The enset (Ensete ventricosum) gardens of Sidama: composition, structure and dynamics of a traditional poly-variety system  J Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution 55:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drew, Roderick. &quot;Micropropagation of Carica papaya and related species.&quot; Micropropagation of Woody Trees and Fruits (2003): 543-564.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criterion often added to the definition of a tree is that it has a [[wood|woody]] trunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gschwantner, Thomas 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lund, H. Gyde. “&quot;A forest” by any other name….&quot; Environmental Science &amp; Policy 2.2 (1999): 125-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sharepoint.cahnrs.wsu.edu/extadmin/bookshelf/Documents/Zobrist, Kevin 2012/Supplemental Materials for External Reviewers/OM1_WWA_NativeTrees.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Such a definition excludes herbaceous trees such as [[banana]]s and [[papayas]]. [[Monocotyledon|Monocots]] such as [[bamboo]] and [[Arecaceae|palms]] may be considered trees under such a definition.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, H. Gyde. “&quot;A forest' by any other name….&quot; Environmental Science &amp; Policy 2.2 (1999): 125-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being herbaceous&lt;ref name=&quot;okaloosa.ifas.ufl.edu&quot;&gt;http://okaloosa.ifas.ufl.edu/Comm_Hort/Pruning.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eeb.ucla.edu&quot;&gt;https://www.eeb.ucla.edu/Faculty/Gibson/Santa_Monica_Mountains_plants/Glossary_UCLA_SantaMonicas.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and not undergoing [[secondary growth]] and never producing wood,&lt;ref name=&quot;german.bio.uci.edu&quot;&gt;http://german.bio.uci.edu/PFK_response.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;botany.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.botany.wisc.edu/courses/botany_400/Lecture/0pdf/25MonocotOrigin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;botany.wisc.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RoddStackhouse2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tony Rodd|author2=Jennifer Stackhouse|title=Trees: A Visual Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mpsc2hsYk1YC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=27 September 2012|date=1 April 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25650-7|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; palms and bamboo may produce &quot;pseudo-wood&quot; by [[lignin|lignifying]] cells produced through primary growth.

Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use. Trees may be defined as plants from which [[lumber]] can be produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;fao.org&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==
Trees are an evolutionary adaptation to competition for space. By growing taller trees are able to compete better for sunlight.&lt;ref name=&quot;LowmanRinker2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret D. Lowman|author2=H. Bruce Rinker|title=Forest Canopies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T9qY2AxnUowC&amp;pg=PA119|accessdate=29 September 2012|date=28 September 2004|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-049134-9|pages=119–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have modified structures that allow them to grow much taller and spread out their foliage, such as thicker stems that are composed of specialized cells that add structural strength and durability. They are long-lived perennial plants that can increase their size each year by producing woody stems. They differ from [[shrub]]s, which are also woody plants, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem;&lt;ref name=&quot;treedictionary&quot;/&gt; but the distinction between a small tree and a large shrub is not always clear,&lt;ref name=&quot;HawthorneLawrence2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Hawthorne|author2=Anna Lawrence|title=Plant Identification: Creating User-Friendly Field Guides for Biodiversity Management|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rHEpVBM5-eIC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=27 September 2012|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84407-079-4|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt; made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas. The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of [[parallel evolution]]. With an estimated 100,000 [[species]], the number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five percent of all living [[plant]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-05-02-890171068_x.htm |title=Scientists to capture DNA of trees worldwide for database |author=Deepti Hajela |accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their greatest number grow in [[tropical]] regions and many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by [[botanist]]s, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plant diversity and complexity patterns: local, regional, and global dimensions: proceedings of an international symposium held at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Copenhagen, Denmark, 25–28 May 2003 |last=Friis |first=Ib |coauthors=Balslev, Henrik; Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab (eds.) |year=2005 |publisher=Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selskab |isbn=8773043044 |pages=57–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees exist in two different groups of [[vascular plants|vascular]] or higher plants, the [[gymnosperm]]s and the [[angiosperm]]s. Both groups are seed plants. The gymnosperm trees include [[conifer]]s, [[cycad]]s, [[Ginkgoales|ginkgophytes]] and [[Gnetophyta|gnetales]].  Angiosperm trees are also known as '''broad-leaved trees'''. Most angiosperm trees are [[eudicots]], the &quot;true dicotyledons&quot;, so named because the seeds contain two [[cotyledon]]s or seed leaves. A relatively smaller number of other angiosperm trees are [[Basal angiosperms|paleodicots]]; these include ''[[Amborella]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[nutmeg]], [[avocado]], and others.

Wood gives structural strength to a tree stem which is used to support the plant as it grows larger. The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do. The three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells.  In trees and other plants that develop wood, the [[vascular cambium]] allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a [[cork cambium]] that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of [[secondary growth]]. 

Trees are either [[evergreen]], having foliage that persists and remains green throughout the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/evergreen |title=Evergreen |work=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[deciduous]], shedding their leaves at the end of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/deciduous |title=Deciduous |work=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most conifers are evergreens but larches (''[[Larix]]'' and ''[[Pseudolarix]]'') are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (''[[Glyptostrobus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'' and ''[[Taxodium]]'') shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as [[cladoptosis]].&lt;ref name=treedictionary/&gt; The [[Crown (botany)|crown]] is a name for the upper part{{clarify|date=September 2012}} of a tree including the branches and leaves &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/crown |title=Crown |work=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/canopy |title=Canopy |work=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sapling is a young tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sapling |title=Sapling |work=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree-like plants include some [[Arecaceae|palms]] which are not trees but herbaceous&lt;ref name=&quot;okaloosa.ifas.ufl.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eeb.ucla.edu&quot;/&gt; monocots that do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood,&lt;ref name=&quot;german.bio.uci.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;botany.wisc.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;botany.wisc.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RoddStackhouse2008&quot;/&gt; and hence do not meet the definition of tree used in this article. In many tree-like palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop so they have tall, unbranched trunks with spirally arranged large leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order [[Cyatheales]], have tree-like growth forms, growing up to {{convert|20|m}} but they are structurally very different from other trees: their trunks are composed of [[Rhizome |rhizomes]] which grow vertically and which are covered by numerous adventitious roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603988/tree-fern |title=Tree fern |author=Yatskievych, George |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
{{weasel words|date=September 2012}}
In places where the climate is suitable, trees are the [[climax vegetation]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In some of the cool temperate regions, conifers tend to predominate, but in much of the southern hemisphere, the tropics, or in warm-temperate climates, broad-leaved trees are more common. Shade tolerance in young trees varies between species, and may determine the pattern of forest succession. 

More than half the species of terrestrial plants and animals on the Earth are thought to live in tropical rainforests even though these occupy just five percent of the land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Diversity of Life |last=Wilson |first=Edward O. |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=0-14-016977-6 |pages=184–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In tropical regions with a [[monsoon climate]], where a drier part of the year alternates with a wet period, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/troprain.htm |title=The tropical rain forest |work=Biomes of the World |publisher=Marietta College |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical regions with a drier [[savanna climate]] have insufficient rainfall to support dense forests{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}; the canopy is not closed and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. ''[[Acacia]]'' and [[baobab]] are well adapted to living in such areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242157/grass-savanna |title=Grass savanna |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[temperateness|cool temperate]] parts of the world, particularly in the northern hemisphere, deciduous broad-leaved trees tend to be replaced by conifers. The long cold winter is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on the forest floor although fungi may abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/forests.php/#boreal |title=The forest biome: Boreal forest |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/treeline_elevation/ |title=High elevation treeline research |author=Körner, Christian |publisher=University of Basel: Institute of Botany |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts and function==
[[File:WisconsinScenery.jpg|thumb|A young [[red pine]] (''Pinus resinosa'') with spread of roots visible, as a result of soil erosion.]]

===Roots===
The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree, and for reproduction defense, survival, energy storage and many, many other purposes.  The first root produced by a newly [[Germination|germinated]] [[seedling]] is a [[taproot]] which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks [[lateral root]]s branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the tap root eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell [[root hair]]s. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as [[potassium]] in solution. The roots require oxygen to [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]] and only a few species such as the [[mangrove]] and the [[Taxodium ascendens|pond cypress]] (''Taxodium ascendens'') can live in permanently waterlogged soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Trees |last=Russell |first=Tony |coauthors=Cutler, Catherine |year=2003 |publisher=Lorenz Books |isbn=0-7548-1292-8 |pages=14–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the soil, the roots encounter the [[hyphae]] of fungi. Many of these are known as [[mycorrhiza]] and form a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waldwissen.net/wald/baeume_waldpflanzen/oekologie/wsl_mykorrhiza_lebensgemeinschaft/index_EN |title=Mycorrhiza&amp;nbsp;– a fascinating symbiosis in the forest |author=Egli, S.; Brunner, I. |year=2011 |work=Forestknowledge |publisher=Swiss Federal Research Institute |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/ecological/mycorrhizas.html |title=Mycorrhizas |author=Puplett, Dan |work=Trees for Life |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early [[Paleozoic]], four hundred million years ago, when the first [[vascular plant]]s colonised dry land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brundrett, Mark C. |year=2002 |title=Coevolution of roots and mycorrhizas of land plants |journal=New Phytologist |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=275–304 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00397.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some trees such as the [[alders]] (''Alnus spp.'') have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with ''[[Frankia]] sp,'', a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia. They have [[Actinorhizal plant|actinorhizal]] root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live. This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.uconn.edu/mcbstaff/benson/Frankia/FrankiaHome.htm |title=Frankia and Actinorhizal Plants |author=Benson, David |publisher=University of Connecticut |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have discovered that certain plant hormones called [[cytokinin]]s initiate root nodule formation and that this process is closely related to the mechanisms involved in mycorrhizal association.

It has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony. The interconnections are made by the [[inosculation]] process, a kind of natural [[grafting]] or welding of vegetal tissues. The tests to demonstrate this networking are performed injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, in a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbor trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hough |first=Walter A. |title=Root extension of Individual trees in surface soils of a Natural Longleaf Pine - Turkey Oak Stand |work=Forest Science |publisher=Society of American Foresters.

[[File:Bombax LalBagh.JPG|thumb|Buttress roots of the kapok tree (''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'')]]

The roots are, generally, a subterranean part of the tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are [[aerial roots|aerial]]. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instances of mechanical stability enhancement is the [[Rhizophora mangle|red mangrove]] that develops [[buttress roots|prop roots]] that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud.&lt;ref name=Singapore&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mangrove.nus.edu.sg/guidebooks/text/1043.htm |title=How plants cope in the mangroves |author= Ng, Peter K.

These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical [[rainforest]]s where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crook, M. J.; Ennos, A. R.; Banks, J. R. |year=1997 |title=The function of buttress roots: a comparative study of the anchorage systems of buttressed (''Aglaia'' and ''Nephelium ramboutan'' species) and non-buttressed (''Mallotus wrayi'') tropical trees |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=1703–1716 |doi=10.1093/jxb/48.9.1703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of excess water. These root extensions are called [[pneumatophores]], and are present, among other, in [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]] and [[Taxodium ascendens|pond cypress]].&lt;ref name=Singapore/&gt;

===Trunk===
[[File:Buk1.JPG|thumb|Beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') trunk in autumn]]
The main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground in order to overtop other plants and shading them out. It also performs the task of transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree and to distribute the food produced by the leaves to all other parts including the roots.&lt;ref name=Russelltrunk&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Trees |last=Russell |first=Tony |coauthors=Cutler, Catherine |year=2003 |publisher=Lorenz Books |isbn=0-7548-1292-8 |pages=16–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Angiosperms and Gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the [[bark]] and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by a large number of fine breathing pores called [[lenticel]]s through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the [[cork cambium]]. The [[Platanus × acerifolia|London plane]] (''Platanus × acerifolia'') periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, the bark of the [[Betula pendula|silver birch]] (''Betula pendula'') peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the [[pine]] (''Pinus spp.'',) the bark exudes sticky [[resin]] which deters attackers whereas in [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]] (''Hevea brasiliensis'') it is a milky [[latex]] that oozes out. The [[Cinchona officinalis|quinine bark tree]] (''Cinchona officinalis'') contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.&lt;ref name=Russelltrunk/&gt; Tree-like plants{{clarify|date=September 2012}} in the [[Pteridophyta]], [[Arecales]], [[Cycadophyta]] and [[Poales]] such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark but all have an outer protective covering of some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology (6th edition) |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |coauthors=Reece, Jane B. |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-201-75054-6 |page=725 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. [[Dutch elm disease]] is caused by a fungus (''[[Ophiostoma]] sp.'') carried from one [[elm]] tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/HCOU-4U4JCL |title=Dutch elm disease in Britain |author=Webber, Joan |publisher=Forest Research |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|A section of yew (''Taxus baccata'') showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood and dark heartwood]]
The innermost layer of bark is known as the [[phloem]] and this is involved in the transport of the [[Plant sap|sap]] containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to other parts of the tree. It is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by [[parenchyma]] cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue.&lt;ref name=Lalonde&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lalonde, S.; Wipf, D.; Frommer, W. B. |year=2004 |title=Transport mechanisms for organic forms of carbon and nitrogen between source and sink |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |volume=55 |pages=341–372 |pmid=15377224 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.55.031903.141758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the [[vascular cambium]] layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as [[xylem]] on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Plant_Bodies_Wood.html |title=Wood, tree trunks and branches |work=BioTech |publisher=Cronodon Museum |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly created xylem is the [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]]. It is composed of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into [[heartwood]] as new sapwood is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood. It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is [[cellulose]], a [[polysaccharide]], and most of the remainder is [[lignin]], a complex [[polymer]].

===Buds and growth===
[[File:Magnolia bud ilustration p.png|thumb|Dormant magnolia (''[[Magnolia]] sp.'') bud]]
[[File:Bourgeon de marronnier (1).jpg|thumb|Bursting horse-chestnut (''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]'') bud]]
Trees do not usually grow continuously throughout the year but mostly have spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest. This pattern of growth is related to the climatic conditions, growth normally ceasing when conditions are either too cold or too dry. In readiness for the inactive period, trees form [[bud]]s to protect the [[meristem]], the zone of active growth. Before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the tip of a twig form scales. These are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath. Inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives. Buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots. A few trees, such as the [[eucalyptus]], have &quot;naked buds&quot; with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.&lt;ref name=buds&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Trees |last=Russell |first=Tony |coauthors=Cutler, Catherine |year=2003 |publisher=Lorenz Books |isbn=0-7548-1292-8 |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars on the surface of the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. [[Arecaceae|Palm trees]] {{clarify|date=September 2012}} have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.&lt;ref name=buds/&gt; In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a [[Lammas growth]] may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=54|issue= 389|pages= 1797–1799|month= August |year=2003|doi= 10.1093/jxb/erg225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary growth is the elongation of the stems and roots. Secondary growth consists of a progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology (6th edition) |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |coauthors=Reece, Jane B. |year=2002 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=0-201-75054-6 |pages=729–730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sooner or later{{which|date=September 2012}} the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. As long as the crown remains in balance with the roots{{clarify|date=September 2012}} the tree should remain healthy but its ability to defend itself against fungal attack is diminished. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Encyclopedia of Trees |last=Russell |first=Tony |coauthors=Cutler, Catherine |year=2003 |publisher=Lorenz Books |isbn=0-7548-1292-8 |pages=16, 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaves===

[[File:Illustration Abies alba0.jpg|thumb|Buds, leaves and reproductive structures of white fir (''[[Abies alba]]'')]]
Trees are much taller than herbaceous or shrubby plants {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}and ensuring the upper-most leaves are supplied with water originating in the root system requires that water is drawn up through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as it evaporates from the leaves.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} If insufficient water is available the leaves will die.&lt;ref name=Transport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Plant_Transport.html |title=Transport in plants |date=2007-01-28 |work=BioTech |publisher=Cronodon Museum |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaves of trees come in a wide range of shapes and sizes which have evolved in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation. They can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen. The needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to those of broad-leaved trees. They are adapted for life in environments where resources are low or water is scarce. Frozen ground may limit water availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees. In many cases, their branches hang down at an angle to the trunk which decreases the likelihood of them breaking when weighed down by snow.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} Broad leaved trees in temperate regions have a different {{clarify|date=September 2012}} strategy for dealing with winter weather. When the days get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer makes new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pessarakli, Mohammad |title=Handbook of Photosynthesis |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0_3XqlcKPpwC&amp;pg=PA725 |accessdate=2012-07-21 |year=2005 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-5839-4 |pages=717–739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesis in the leaf of a [[plant hormone]] called [[auxin]] also ceases. This causes the cells at the junction of the petiole and the twig to weaken and sooner or later the joint breaks and the leaf floats to the ground. In tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their leaves all year round. Individual leaves may fall intermittently and be replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time. Other tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves annually at a particular time of year.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Often this will coincide with the onset of the dry season or some other climatic event.{{clarify|date=September 2012}} Many deciduous trees flower before the new leaves emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephen H. |last=Bullock |coauthors=Solis-Magallanes, J.

===Reproduction===

{{main|Plant reproduction}}
[[File:Cycas circinalis(draw).jpg|thumb|Form, leaves and reproductive structures of queen sago ''[[Cycas circinalis]]'']]
Tree forms are found in a wide range of plants and their reproductive strategies are substantially the same as shrub or herbaceous plant forms.

Many trees are wind pollinated which may be an evolutionary adaptation to take advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground, particularly in the case of those that produce pollen before the leaves emerge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/forest/ecological/pollination.html Trees for life&amp;nbsp;– Pollination]&lt;/ref&gt; A vast quantity of pollen is produced because of the low likelihood of any particular grain landing on an appropriate female flower. Wind-pollinated flowers of broad-leaved trees are characterised by a lack of showy parts, no scent and a copious production of pollen, often with separate male and female flowers, or separate male and female trees. The male flowers may be high up in the tree, often in the form of dangling [[catkin]]s. The female flowers may be lower down the tree. The pollen of [[pine]] trees contains air sacs which give it buoyancy and it has been known to travel as far as {{convert|800|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467948/pollination/75903/Wind |title=Pollination: Wind |author=Meeuse, Bastiaan J. D. |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tree pollen can cause [[Allergy|allergies]].

===Seeds===
Seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary greatly in size and shape. Some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, ''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'', produces one of the smallest tree seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence C. Walker|title=Forests: A Naturalist's Guide to Woodland Trees|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LNJqY52pdSwC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=27 September 2012|year=1997|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-79112-1|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great diversity in tree [[fruit]]s and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to [[Seed dispersal|disperse]] their offspring.

For a tree seeding to grow into an adult tree it needs light and space, if seeds only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from flourishing. Many seeds such as [[birch]] are small and have papery wings to aid dispersal by the wind. [[Ash (Fraxinus)|Ash]] trees and [[maple]]s have larger seeds with blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.&lt;ref name=Dispersal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vtaide.com/png/seed-dispersion.htm |title=How seeds are dispersed |author=Meng, Alan; Meng, Hui |work=Interactive Assessment Worksheets |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delonix regia|flame tree]] does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart explosively on drying.&lt;ref name=Dispersal/&gt; The miniature cone-like catkins of [[Alder]] trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water.

==Evolutionary history==
[[File:PSM V16 D476 Principal palms and cycadeae of middle tertiary europe.jpg|thumb|Palms and cycads as they might have appeared in the middle Tertiary]]
The earliest tree-like organisms were [[tree fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[lycophytes]], which grew in [[forest]]s in the [[Carboniferous]] period. The first tree may have been [[Wattieza]], fossils of which have been found in New York State in 2007 dating back to the [[Middle Devonian]] (about 385 million years ago). Prior to this discovery, ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' was the earliest known tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.2307/2805124 |author = Beck, Charles B. |year = 1960 |title = The identity of ''Archaeopteris'' and ''Callixylon'' |journal = Brittonia |volume = 12 |issue = 4 |pages = 351–368 |jstor = 2805124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the [[gymnosperm]]s which evolved in the [[Triassic]] period. The gymnosperms include conifers, [[cycad]]s, [[Gnetophyta|gnetales]] and [[ginkgo]]s and these may have appeared as a result of a [[Gene duplication|whole genome duplication event]] which took place about 319 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jiao, Y.; Wickett, N.

During the Mesozoic (245 to 65 million years ago) the conifers flourished and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats. Subsequently the tree forms of [[flowering plant]]s evolved during the [[Cretaceous]] period. These began to [[dominance (ecology)|dominate]] the conifers during the [[Tertiary]] era (65 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first of four [[ice age]]s occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the [[interglacial]]s, trees recolonised the land{{clarify|date=September 2012}}  only to be driven back again at the start of the next ice age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfs.org.uk/learning/tree-evolution |title=Tree evolution |year=2012 |work=Tree Biology |publisher=Royal Forestry Society |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epiphyte|Epiphytic]] plants such as [[fern]]s, some mosses, liverworts, [[orchid]]s and some species of [[parasite|parasitic]] plants (e.g., [[mistletoe]]) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of [[biodiversity]] and ecosystem balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y2328e/y2328e00.htm |title=Trees outside forests |author=Bellefontaine, R.; Petit, S.; Pain-Orcet, M.; Deleporte, P.; Bertault, J-G |year=2002 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees can play a role in the development of an ecosystem,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} for example in [[mangrove]] swamps the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and hence trap water-borne sediment, leading over time to a reduction in water depth and the creation of suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation.

==Uses==
[[Silviculture]] is the practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a [[grove (nature)|grove]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grove |title=Grove |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copse |title=Copse |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called [[woodland]] or [[forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/forest |title=Forest |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding is known as a [[plantation]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofforestry.org/dict/term/plantation |title=Plantation |date=2008-10-27 |work=Dictionary of Forestry |publisher=Society of American Foresters |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/orchard |title=Orchard |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[biotope]]s are defined largely by the trees that inhabit them, examples being [[rainforest]] and [[taiga]].

Trees have conservation value and add interest to the landscape. They can be planted as isolated specimens in hedgerows or as shelter belts. They provide shade for people and animals. They can be planted in grand avenues in parkland or alongside roads in town and country.

===Food===
[[File:Forest honey.jpg|thumb|Forest honey]]
[[File:Maple syrup taps.jpg|thumb|Sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]'') being tapped]]
Trees are the source of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, cherries and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, coconuts and other nuts, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (''[[Elaeis guineensis]]''). The fruits of the cocoa tree (''[[Theobroma cacao]]'') are used to make [[cocoa solids|cocoa]] and [[chocolate]] and the berries of coffee trees, (''[[Coffea arabica]]'') and (''[[Coffea canephora]]''), are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5325e/x5325e0c.htm |title=Monetary valuation of tree-based resources in Zimbabwe |author=Campbell, B. |year=1993 |publisher=FAO: Forestry Department |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many trees have flowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees. The production of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the developing world where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tropicalforest.com/Tropical_Forest/Tropical_Forest_home.html |title=Honey |publisher=Tropical Forest |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowers of the elder (''[[Sambucus]]'') are used to make [[elderflower cordial]] and petals of the plum (''[[Prunus]] spp.'') can be candied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07237.html/ |title=Edible flowers |author=Newman, S.

The leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes them bitter. Leaves of the curry tree (''[[Murraya koenigii]]'') are eaten, those of kaffir lime ''[[kaffir lime|Citrus × hystrix]]'' (e.g., [[Thai food]]&lt;ref name=thaitravel&gt;{{cite web|last=Loha-unchit |first=Kasma |title=Kaffir Lime: Magrood |work=Thai Food and Travel |url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/ingredients/klime.html|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''[[Ailanthus]]'' (e.g., in [[Korean food|Korean]] dishes such as [[bugak]]) and those of the European bay tree (''[[Laurus nobilis]]'') and the California bay tree (''[[Umbellularia californica]]'') are used for flavouring food.&lt;ref name=spices&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ecoph16.htm |title=Allspice, bay rum, bay leaves, capers, cloves, cinnamon, camphor, witch hazel and nutmeg |author=Armstrong, Wayne P. |date=2012-06-01 |work=Wayne's Word |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'', the source of [[tea]], is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upasitearesearch.org/tea-cultivation-practices/ |title=Tea cultivation and practices |publisher=Upasi Tea Research Foundation |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate climates there is a sudden movement of [[Plant sap|sap]] at the end of the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]'') is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, [[maple syrup]]. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals.&lt;ref name=Cavette&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-3/Maple-Syrup.html |title=Maple syrup |author=Cavette, Michael |work=How products are made |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%.&lt;ref name=Cavette/&gt; A similar process happens in northern Europe when the spring rise in the [[Birch sap|sap]] of the silver birch (''[[Betula pendula]]'') is tapped and collected. This is either drunk fresh or is fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (''[[Betula lenta]]'') is similarly collected and converted into birch syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap and one hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alaskabirchsyrup.com/abbisy.html |title=About birch syrup |publisher=Alaska Wild Harvest |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various parts of trees are used as spices. These include [[cinnamon]], made from the bark of the cinnamon tree (''[[Cinnamomum zeylanicum]]'') and [[all spice]], the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (''Pimenta dioica''). [[Nutmeg]] is a seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (''Myristica fragrans'') and [[clove]]s are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (''Syzygium aromaticum''). [[Sassafras]] oil is an important flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of (''Sassafras albidum'').&lt;ref name=spices/&gt;

===Fuel===
{{main|Wood fuel}}
[[File:Selling fuelwood.jpeg|thumb|Selling firewood at a market]]
Wood has traditionally been used for [[fuel]], especially in rural areas. In less developed nations it may be the only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/idrw/index-2008.html |title=Women watch: International Day of Rural Women |author= |date=2008-10-15 |publisher=United Nations Inter-agency Network on Women and Gender Equality |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern [[wood-burning stove]]s are very fuel efficient and new products such as [[wood pellet]]s are available to burn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/ |title=Burn Wise |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charcoal]] can be made by slow [[pyrolysis]] of wood by heating it in the absence of air in a [[kiln]]. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in [[barbecue]]s and by [[blacksmith]]s and has many industrial and other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands.co.uk/blog/practical-guides/how-do-you-make-charcoal/ |title=How do you make charcoal? |work=Woodlands.co.uk |publisher=Woodland Investment Management |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smoking (cooking)|Wood smoke]] can be used to preserve food. In the hot smoking process the food is exposed to smoke and heat in a controlled environment. The food is ready to eat when the process is complete, having been tenderised and flavoured by the smoke it has absorbed. In the cold process, the temperature is not allowed to rise above {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The flavour of the food is enhanced but raw food requires further cooking. If it is to be preserved, meat should be [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] before cold smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The rise and rise of smoking food |author=Mackenzie, Sophie |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/jan/30/rise-of-smoking-food |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timber===
{{main|Wood}}
[[File:Timberwork2.JPG|thumb|Joinery and roof trusses made from softwood]]
Wood has been an important, easily available material for [[construction]] since humans started building shelters. [[Engineered wood]] products are available which bind the particles, fibres or [[Wood veneer|veneers]] of wood together with adhesives to form composite materials. Plastics have taken over from wood for some traditional uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3609E/Y3609E00.HTM |title=Environmental and energy balances of wood products and substitutes |author=Scharai-Rad, Mohammad; Welling, Johannes |year=2002 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood is used in the construction of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses, roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.&lt;ref name=Appalachian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appalachianwood.org/utilization.htm |title=Wood utilization |publisher=Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood is used to construct carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.&lt;ref name=Appalachian/&gt;

Wood is pulped for [[paper]] and used in the manufacture of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as [[Medium-density fibreboard|fibreboard]], [[hardboard]], [[Particle board|chipboard]] and [[plywood]].&lt;ref name=Appalachian/&gt;  The wood of conifers is known as [[softwood]] while that of broad-leaved trees is [[hardwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/forests/gloss.html |title=Glossary of Forestry Terms |author=Pywell, Nancy |date=2003-10-07 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bark===
[[File:CorkOakStripped.jpg|thumb|Recently stripped cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]'')]]
[[Cork (material)|Cork]] is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''). It is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=4951 |title=Cork Flooring is Environmentally Sustainable |author= |date=2006-02-27 |publisher=AZoM.com |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles.&lt;ref name=cork&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/Geography/Ivogeler/Travel/Portugal/cork-article2.htm |title=The cork industry in Portugal |author=Calheiros e Meneses, J.

The bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in Europe for the [[tanning]] of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, [[tannin]], is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3. Tanneries, Description of the Tanning Process |accessdate=2012-07-26 |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6114E/x6114e05.htm#b1-3.1.%20Description%20of%20the%20tanningprocess }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commonly used spice [[Cinnamon]] is obtained from the bark from a number of species of the genus ''[[Cinnamomum]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2008 |chapter=Cinnamon |quote=(species Cinnamomum zeylanicum), bushy evergreen tree of the laurel family (Lauraceae) cultivated for the spice consisting of its dried inner bark.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one hundred and twenty drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of trees.&lt;ref name=rainforest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforest-database.com/plants/plantdrugs.htm |title=Plant Based Drugs and Medicines |author=Taylor, Leslie |date=2000-10-13 |work=The Healing Power of Rainforest Herbs |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quinine]] originates from the cinchona tree (''[[Cinchona]]'') and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines for the treatment of malaria |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://apps.who.int/malaria/docs/TreatmentGuidelines2006.pdf |year=2006|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspirin was synthesized to replace the [[sodium salicylate]] derived from the bark of willow trees (''[[Salix]]'') which had unpleasant side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|11124191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-cancer drug [[Paclitaxel]] is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Jordan | last2 = Walsh |first2=Vivien | title = The Story of Taxol: Nature and Politics in the Pursuit of an Anti-Cancer Drug | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-521-56123-X |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (''[[Carica papaya]]''), the cassia (''[[Cassia (legume)|Cassia spp.]]''), the cocoa tree (''[[Theobroma cacao]]''), the tree of life (''[[Camptotheca acuminata]]'') and the downy birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'').&lt;ref name=rainforest/&gt;

The papery bark of the white birch tree (''[[Betula papyrifera]]'') was used extensively by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. [[Wigwam]]s were covered by it and [[canoe]]s were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nativetech.org/brchbark/brchbark.htm |title=Uses for birch bark |author=Prindle, Tara |year=1994 |publisher=NativeTech: Native American Technology and Art |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orchid-growing-secrets.com/choosing-the-right-potting-media-for-your-orchid/ |title=Choosing the right potting media for your orchid |author=Johnson, Aidan |date=2011-01-25 |work=Orchid growing secrets |accessdate=2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
[[File:Latex dripping.JPG|thumb|Latex being collected from the rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'')]]
[[Latex]] is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the latex used to make [[natural rubber]] is the Pará rubber tree (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in [[Tire|tyres]] for which synthetic materials have proved less durable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2101 |title=Natural rubber: History and Developments in the Natural Rubber Industry |author=Baker, C |year=1997 |work=Materials World |publisher=AZoM.com |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latex exuded by the balatá tree (''[[Manilkara bidentata]]'') is used to make golf balls and is similar to [[gutta-percha]], made from the latex of the &quot;getah perca&quot; tree ''[[Palaquium]]''. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/GuttaPercha/ |title=The Gutta Percha Company |author=Burns, Bill |date=2010-02-15 |work=History of the Atlantic Cable and Undersea Communications |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Resin]] is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose. It is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] liquid composed mainly of volatile [[terpene]]s and is produced mostly by coniferous trees. It is used in varnishes, for making small castings and in [[ten-pin bowling]] balls. When heated, the terpenes are driven off and the remaining product is called &quot;rosin&quot; and is used by stringed instrumentalists on their [[Bow (music)|bows]]. Some resins contain [[essential oil]]s and are used in [[incense]] and [[aromatherapy]]. Fossilized resin is known as [[amber]] and was mostly formed in the [[Cretaceous]] (145 to 65 million years ago) or more recently. The resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/ted/amber.htm |title=Amber Trade and the Environment in the Kaliningrad Oblast |author=Jacobson, Douglas |year=1997 |work=The Mandala Projects |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The camphor tree (''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'') produces an essential oil &lt;ref name=spices/&gt; and the eucalyptus tree (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]'') is the main source of [[eucalyptus oil]] which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.organicfacts.net/organic-oils/natural-essential-oils/health-benefits-of-eucalyptus-essential-oil.html |title=Health benefits of eucalyptus essential oil |work=Organic facts |publisher=Organic Information Services |accessdate=2012-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
Dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of [[drought]], trees can fall into [[water stress]], which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a [[garden hose]], soaker hose, [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]], or modified five-gallon bucket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texasforestservice.tamu.edu/main/default.aspx |title=Texas drought |work=Texas A&amp;M Forest Service |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University System |accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
{{main|Tree worship}}
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash (Norse)]]
[[File:General Sherman tree looking up.jpg|thumb|Looking upwards from the base of the General Sherman Tree]]
Trees have been venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient [[Celtic tree worship|Celts]], certain trees held special significance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wicca.com/celtic/celtic/sactrees.htm |title=Sacred Celtic Trees and Woods |author=Collins, Ed |work=The Celtic Connection |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, [[dryad]]s were believed to be shy nymphs who inhabited trees. The [[Tree of Life]] or [[World Tree]] linked the dead with the living and was associated with the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth Goddess]] who brought fertility.

The [[Oubangui]] people of west Africa plant a tree when a child is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is considered at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit lives on in the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t9450e/t9450e06.htm |title=The cultural and symbolic importance of forest resources |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens. The best known example from European mythology is the ancient Norse [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nordic Runes: Understanding, Casting, and Interpreting the Ancient Viking Oracle |last=Mountfort |first=Paul Rhys |year=2003 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company |pages=41, 279 |isbn=0-89281-093-9 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_3B7EmvAqngC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, [[Kalpavriksha]] is a wish-fulfilling tree that was one of nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean.

Sacred groves exist in China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They are places where the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves may be the only [[relict]]s of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Laird, Sarah |year=1999 |title=Trees, forests and sacred groves |journal=The Overstory |volume=93 | publisher =Agroforestry Net |url=http://agroforestry.net/overstory/overstory93.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Ancient Indian [[tree deity|tree deities]], such as Puliyidaivalaiyamman, the [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] deity of the [[tamarind|tamarind tree]], or Kadambariyamman, associated with the [[kadamba tree]] were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/nature_trees.htm Mythical Trees and Deities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the trunk is used in the calculation and the volume is estimated to be 1,487&amp;nbsp;m³ (52,508&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;ft). Also in California is the oldest living tree with a verified age. It is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (''[[Pinus longaeva]]'') called [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah]] growing in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]]. It has been dated by drilling a core sample and counting the annual rings and was considered to be 4,844 years old in 2012.&lt;ref name=bp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title=''Pinus longaeva'' |author=Earle, Christopher J. |date=2012-04-25 |work=The Gymnosperm Database |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought likely that other bristlecone pines exceed 5,000 years of age.&lt;ref name=bp/&gt; A little further south, at [[Santa Maria del Tule]], [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, is the tree with the broadest trunk. It is a Montezuma cypress (''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'') known as [[Árbol del Tule]] and its diameter at breast height is {{convert|11.62|m|ft|abbr=on}} giving it a girth of {{convert|36.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The tree's trunk is far from round and the exact dimensions may be misleading as the circumference includes much empty space between the large buttress roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/cu/Taxodium_mucronatum.php |title=''Taxodium mucronatum'' |author=Earle, Christopher J. |date=2012-04-25 |work=The Gymnosperm Database |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
