{{Forms of government}}

'''Politics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''politikos'' &quot;of, for, or relating to citizens&quot;) is the [[art]] or [[science]] of influencing people on a civic, or individual level, when there are more than 2 people involved.

Modern political discourse focuses on democracy and the relationship between people and politics.  It is thought of as the way we &quot;choose government officials and make decisions about public policy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Losco|first=Joseph|title=AmGov|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Ep strasbourg 6.jpg|left|thumb|[[European Parliament]]]]
The word ''politics'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word [[Politics (Aristotle)|Πολιτικά]] (''politika''), modeled on [[Aristotle]]'s &quot;affairs of the city&quot;, the name of his book on governing and governments, which was rendered in English in the mid-15th century as Latinized &quot;Polettiques&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=politics |title=Politics |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it became &quot;politics&quot; in [[Middle English]] c. 1520s (see the [[Concise Oxford Dictionary]]). The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus |title=A Latin Dictionary |author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others &quot;of, for, or relating to citizens&quot;, &quot;civil&quot;, &quot;civic&quot;, &quot;belonging to the state&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs πολιτικός |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), &quot;citizen&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpoli%2Fths πολίτης |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), &quot;city&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpo%2Flis πόλις |author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of politics is reflected in the origin and development, and economics of the institutions of [[government]].

=== The state ===
{{Main|State (polity)}}
[[File:Sun-tzu.jpg|right |thumb |[[Sun Tzu]]]]

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the [[Art of Warfare|art of warfare]]. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21|year=1970|month=August|volume=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the French Revolution put an end to the &quot;[[divine right of kings]]&quot;.  Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to the 21st Century AD British Monarchy.  Kingship becomes an institution through heredity.

The king often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|Council]] without which he could not maintain power. As these advisors, and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Long before the council became a bulwark of democracy, it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

# Preserving the institution of kingship through heredity.
# Preserving the traditions of the social order.

The greatest of the king's subordinates, the [[earls]], [[archduke]]s and [[dukes]] in England and Scotland, the [[dukes]] and [[counts]] in the Continent, always sat as a right on the Council. A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]]. One of the functions of the Council is to keep the coffers of the king full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=73–96 |quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and property ====
[[Property]] is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual. A right is a power enforced by public trust. Sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust. Nevertheless, a right is really an institution brought around by public trust, past, present or future. The growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution. The more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual, the more it is appropriated. The appearance of the State brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry. In the presence of the State, man can hold landed property. The State began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came [[inheritance]]. With landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods, profit, so that in modern times, the &quot;lord of the land&quot; of long ago becomes the landlord. If it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same, then there is of course no evolution of property whatever. However, the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefitting the landlord. The landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services. In industry, the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry, the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit. Towards the latter part of the Middle Ages in Europe, both the State - the State would use the instrument of [[confiscation]] for the first time to satisfy a debt - and the Church - the Church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land - were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today, the village has become the ideal of the [[individualist]], a place in which every man &quot;does what he wills with his own.&quot; The State has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=97–111 |quote=No political institution is of greater importance, none has been the subject of greater controversy, than the institution of property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and the justice system ====
As a primarily military institution, the State is concerned with the [[allegiance]] of its subjects viewing disloyalty and [[espionage]] as well as other sorts of [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] as detrimental to its national security. Thus arises the law of [[treason]]. Criminal acts in general, breaking the peace and treason make up the whole, or at least part of [[criminal law]] enforced by the State as distinguished from [[Private law|the law enforced by private individuals or by the state on behalf of private individuals]]. State justice has taken the place of clan, feudal, merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength, skill and simplicity. One very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that, until comparatively late in history, the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings. The [[trial by jury]] was adopted by the Royal Courts, securing it's popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty. By the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], with the separation of Church and State, in the most progressive countries, the State succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=112–124 |quote=We are so accustomed to look upon the administration of justice as an inevitable duty of the State...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state ====
The making of laws was unknown to primitive societies.

That most persistent of all patriarchal societies, the [[Jewish]], retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the [[Gentile]] cities of the West. This tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society, it was [[convention (norm)|custom]] or [[observance]] sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The state of affairs which existed in the 10th century, when every town had its own laws and nations like France, Germany, Spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century, was brought to an end  by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

# '''Records:''' From the early Middle Ages in Europe there come what are called folk-laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is becoming the State. They are due almost universally to one cause: the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects. These are not legislation in the sense of law-making but statements or declarations of custom. They are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people. Unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written. It is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says. Nevertheless, the written text can change by addition with every new edition.
# '''Law Courts:''' By taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences, English common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom. The reason why in the rest of Europe, there was no common law till centuries later is because the State in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when England did. One of the shrewdest moves by which the English judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to [[questions of fact]]. At first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact; and being a purely local body, they followed local custom. A famous division came to pass: the province of the judge and the province of the jury.
# '''Fictions:''' Records and Law Courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law-making but like Fictions, they were slow and imperfect. Though slowly, Fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open.

Finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation. When progress and development is rapid, the faster method of [[political representation]] is adopted. This method does not originate in primitive society but in the State need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same. From the town assembly, a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang [[Parliament]] all over Europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy. The clergy had amassed a fortune in land, about one-fifth of all Christendom but at the time, in the 12th and 13th centuries, the Church was following a policy of isolation; they adopted the rule of [[celibacy]] and cut themselves from domestic life; they refused to plead in a secular court; they refused to pay taxes to the State on the grounds that they had already paid it to the [[Pope]]. Since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money, the Church could not be left out and so they came to Parliament. The Church did not like it but in most cases they had to come.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The medieval Parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm: nobles, clergy, peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant [[taxation]]. Only by the strongest pressure of the Crown were Parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the Crown was weak, Parliament ceased to exist. The notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts. Originally, the representative side of Parliament was solely concerned with money; representation in Parliament was a liability rather than a privilege. It is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another. People who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to [[petition]]. Pretty soon, sessions in Parliament would turn into bargaining tables, the king granting petitions in exchange for money. However, there were two kinds of petitions, one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or [[legislation]] originated. The king as head of State could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place. Even to the present day, this has always been the basis of all successful legislation: public custom is adopted and enforced by the State.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the early days of political representation, the [[majority]] did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested [[election]]s but by the beginning of the 15th century, a seat in Parliament was something to be cherished. Historically speaking, the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times: the [[party system]]. The party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate; its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics; it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

These three institutions: political representation, majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery; they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=124–139 |quote=As we have before stated (p. 41), the notion that law could be made was unknown to primitive society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The state and the executive system ====
The administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government. In the enactment and enforcement of laws, the victory of the State is complete but not so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic, religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Image:Kanzler21a.jpg|thumb|left|The [[German Chancellery]] (Bundeskanzleramt) in [[Berlin]]]]
Originally, the state was a military institution. For many years, it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people. Slowly, however, the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the State without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making. One of the basic functions of the State in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order; it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens. To maintain law and order the State develops means of [[communication]]. Historically, the &quot;king's highway&quot; was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to [[commerce]]. In almost all countries, the State maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] are rather limited. The State's original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to [[police]] administration which is a branch of the dispensation of [[Justice]] but on its preventive side, police jurisdiction has a special character of its own, which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work. In the [[curfew]], the State shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder. In early days, next to maintaining law and order, the State was concerned with the raising of [[revenue]].  It was then useful to the State to establish a [[Technical standard|standard]] of [[weights and measures]] so that value could be generally accepted and finally the State acquired a [[monopoly]] of [[coin]]age. The regulation of labor by the State as one of its functions dates from the 15th century, when [[the Black Plague]] killed around half of the European population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The invariable policy of the State has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual. This was the policy until [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' was published promoting a strong public reaction against State interference. By its own action, the State raised the issue of the poor or the State relief of the [[indigent]]. The State, of course, did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village, the church and the [[guild]]s, it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it. The Great Poor Law Report of 1834 showed that [[communism]] was widespread in the rural areas of England. In newly developed countries such as the [[colonies]] of the [[British Empire]], the State has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty, although the poor classes lean heavily towards State socialism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Taking into account the arguably significant powers of the State, it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general State aid.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Political representation has helped to shape State administration. When the voice of the individual can be heard, the danger of arbitrary interference by the State is greatly reduced. To that extent is the increase of State activity popular. There are no hard and fast rules to limit State administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the State is the nation and what the State does is necessarily for the good of the nation. In the first place, even in modern times, the State and the nation are never identical. Even where &quot;universal suffrage&quot; prevails, the fact remains that an extension of State administration means an increased interference of some by others, limiting freedom of action. Even if it is admitted that State and nation are one and the same, it is sometimes difficult to admit that State administration is necessarily good. Finally, the modern indiscriminate advocacy of State administration conceals the fallacy that State officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than [[private enterprise]]. Herein lies the basic difference between [[Public administration|Public]] and [[Business Administration]]; the first deals with the [[public weal]] while the second deals basically in [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] but both require a great deal of [[education]] and [[ethical code|ethical conduct]] to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only relating to [[Corporate law|business]] and [[labour rights|labour]] but also the State and the people administrating its [[government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |pages=140–150 |quote=We come now to the last, and by far the most difficult department of State activity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The varieties of political experience ====
&lt;!-- [[File:The Ratification of the Treaty of Munster, Gerard Ter hey (1648).jpg|right |thumb |[[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648), resulting from the first modern diplomatic congress, instituted the legal concept of sovereignty.]] deleted file--&gt;
[[File:The Ratification of the Treaty of Munster, Gerard Ter Borch (1648).jpg|thumb|right|280px|''The swearing of the oath of ratification of the treaty of Münster in 1648'' (1648) by [[Gerard ter Borch]].]]

According to Aristotle, States are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to an increase in knowledge of the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned. Generally speaking, no form of government could be considered the absolute best, as it would have to be the perfect form under all circumstances, for all people and in all ways. As an institution created by the human nature to [[Governance|govern society]], it is vulnerable to [[political corruption|abuse by people for their own gain]], no matter what form of government a state utillises, thus posing that there is no 'best' form of government.

All States are varieties of a single type, the sovereign State. All the [[Great Powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a Constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten Constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the Legislative branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate. Nevertheless, the written constitution is essential. England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are two forms of government, one a strong central government as in France and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in England that is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1870 and in the 20th century, [[Australia]]. The Federal States introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]]'s singular weakness is that it lacks [[judicial power]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the [[American Civil War]], the contention of the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the Federal government in the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenks |first=Edward |title=A history of politics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q= |pages=1–164 |year=1900 |publisher=J.

===Political party===
{{Main|political party}}
A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[Atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the development of the [[Hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |url=http://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely |page=566 |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |isbn=0-19-534334-2 {{Please check ISBN|reason=Check digit (2) does not correspond to calculated figure.}} |quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as &quot;who gets what, when, and how&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-538-49719-0|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who has defined politics as &quot;responding to conflict with dialogue,&quot; offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Blattberg, Charles, &quot;Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies,&quot; in ''Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy'', Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1755117]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spectra==
[[Image:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|300px|Political views differ on average across nations. A recreation of the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map of the World based on the [[World Values Survey]].]]

{{Main|Political spectrum}}
Several different [[political spectrum]]s have been proposed.

===Left-right politics===
{{Main|Left–right politics}}
Recently in history, political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knapp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Frederick Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification]] while the left wing often values [[reform]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C |author=Daniel J. Levinson |title=CONSERVATISM AND RADICALISM |publisher=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality, while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobbio&quot;&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, &quot;Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction&quot; (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. ISBN 0-226-06246-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, &quot;In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy, [[Gaullism]] in France, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, and [[National Action Party (Mexico)#&quot;National Action&quot; politics|National Action Politics]] in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Authoritarian-libertarian politics===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where &quot;individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|author-separator=,|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as [[sovereign]]. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]], who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[Political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, theoretically, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of [[society]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt; or, in much of the world, simply ''liberalism'') is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], &quot;the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 
For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] &quot;Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. BLACK ROSE BOOKS LID. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political corruption==
{{Main|Political corruption}}
{{cquote2|Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it.| [[William Pitt the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;''Safire's political dictionary'', by William Safire, 2008, Oxford University Press US, pg 566&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[exortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Political corruption#Graft|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] such as [[drug trafficking]], [[money laundering]], and [[human trafficking|trafficking]], it is not restricted to these activities. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm African corruption 'on the wane'], 10 July 2007, [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning &quot;rule by thieves&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|By the mid 20th century, humans had achieved a mastery of technology sufficient to leave the atmosphere of the Earth for the first time and [[space exploration|explore space]].]]
The word '''technology''' refers to the making, modification, usage, and knowledge of [[tool]]s, [[machine]]s, techniques, [[craft]]s, [[system]]s, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, including machinery, modifications, arrangements and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include ''construction technology'', ''medical technology'', and ''information technology''.

The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The [[prehistory|prehistorical]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|the ability to control fire]] increased the available sources of food and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of [[weapon]]s of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from [[club (weapon)|clubs]] to [[nuclear weapon]]s.

Technology has affected [[society]] and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[leisure]] [[Social class|class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as [[pollution]], and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the [[Earth]] and its [[natural environment|environment]]. Various implementations of technology influence the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.

Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other [[primates]] and certain [[dolphin]] communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.

==Definition and usage==
[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The invention of the [[printing press]] made it possible for [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s to communicate their ideas with ease, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as a cultural force.]]
The use of the term ''technology'' has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and usually referred to the description or study of the [[useful arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Crabb&quot;&gt;For ex., [[George Crabb (writer)|George Crabb]], [http://www.archive.org/stream/universaltechno01crabgoog#page/n525 ''Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences, Containing Definitions Drawn From the Original Writers''], (London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1823), s.v. &quot;technology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term was often connected to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stratton&quot;&gt;Julius Adams Stratton and Loretta H. Mannix, Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2005), 190-92. ISBN
0262195240.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Technology&quot; rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The meanings of technology changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of [[:de:Technik|Technik]] into &quot;technology.&quot; In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'' that is absent in English, as both terms are usually translated as &quot;technology.&quot; By the 1930s, &quot;technology&quot; referred not to the study of the industrial arts, but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schatzberg&quot;&gt;Eric Schatzberg, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/technology_and_culture/v047/47.3schatzberg.html &quot;''Technik'' Comes to America: Changing Meanings of ''Technology'' Before 1930,&quot;] ''Technology and Culture'' 47 (July 2006): 486-512.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that &quot;technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bain&quot;&gt;Read Bain, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2084365 &quot;Technology and State Government,&quot;] American Sociological Review 2 (December 1937): 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. But equally prominent is the definition of technology as applied science, especially among scientists and engineers, although most social scientists who study technology reject this definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKenzie&quot;&gt;Donald A. MacKenzie and Judy Wajcman, &quot;Introductory Essay&quot; in ''The Social Shaping of Technology'', 2nd ed. (Buckingham, England : Open University Press, 1999) ISBN 0-335-19913-5.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of &quot;technique&quot; to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on [[technologies of the self]] (&quot;techniques de soi&quot;).

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionary offers a definition of the term: &quot;the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area&quot; and &quot;a capability given by the practical application of knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology | title=Definition of technology | accessdate=2007-02-16 | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 &quot;Real World of Technology&quot; lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is &quot;practice, the way we do things around here&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.anansi.ca/titles.cfm?series_id=4&amp;pub_id=58 | title=Real World of Technology | accessdate=2007-02-13 | author=Franklin, Ursula | publisher=[[House of Anansi Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/default.stm | title=Technology news | accessdate=2006-02-17 | publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as &quot;the pursuit of life by means other than life&quot;, and as &quot;organized inorganic matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]] | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=0-8047-3041-5 | pages=17, 82}} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as &quot;organized inorganic matter,&quot; given that it is, rather, &quot;the reorganization of the organic.&quot; {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=2-7071-5495-4 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm | work=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002 | title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas | accessdate=2007-05-07 | publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;technology&quot; can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as &quot;medical technology&quot; or &quot;space technology&quot;, it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. &quot;[[State-of-the-art]] technology&quot; refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

[[File:C4004 (Intel).jpg|thumbnail|right|The invention of integrated circuits and the [[microprocessor]] (here, an [[Intel 4004]] chip from 1971) led to the modern [[computer revolution]].]]
Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Borgmann | first=Albert | authorlink=Albert Borgmann | year=2006 | title=Technology as a Cultural Force: For Alena and Griffin | journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=351–360 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_journal_of_sociology/v031/31.3borgmann.html | format=fee required | accessdate=2007-02-16 | doi=10.1353/cjs.2006.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of [[communication]] technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and, as a result, has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of [[cyberculture]] has, at its basis, the development of the [[Internet]] and the [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macek.czechian.net/defining_cyberculture.htm | title=Defining Cyberculture | accessdate=2007-05-25 | author=Macek, Jakub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate [[political oppression]] and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both [[science]] and [[engineering]], each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.

==Science, engineering and technology==
The distinction between science, engineering and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is the [[reasoned]] investigation or study of phenomena, aimed at discovering enduring principles among elements of the [[phenomenal]] world by employing [[Formality|formal]] techniques such as the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/science | title=Science | accessdate=2007-02-17 | publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]] and [[safety]].

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering — although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s, by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines, such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ | title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology | accessdate=2007-02-17 | publisher=[[Intute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact relations between [[science and technology]] in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, in the United States it was widely considered that technology was simply &quot;applied science&quot; and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science—The Endless Frontier'': &quot;New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&amp;nbsp;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.&quot; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious—though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=George |last=Wise |title=Science and Technology |journal=Osiris (2nd Series) |volume=1 |year=1985 |pages=229–246 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=David H. |last=Guston |title=Between politics and science: Assuring the integrity and productivity of research |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-65318-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of tools by [[Homo (genus)|early humans]] was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a [[Australopithecus afarensis|species]] of [[foraging]] [[hominids]] which were already [[bipedal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/human/human_evolution/mother_of_man1.shtml|title=Mother of man – 3.2 million years ago |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=212317|title=Human Evolution|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History channel]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423204038/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=212317 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and [[behavioral modernity|complex set of behaviors]] emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DF173CF936A25754C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title= Early Voices: The Leap to Language |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2003-07-15|author=Wade, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stone tools====

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=2007-12-08 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] &quot;industry&quot;, date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=2007-02-18 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=1999-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | month=April | year=1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or &quot;Old stone age&quot;, and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a &quot;[[lithic core|core]]&quot; of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced a sharp edge on the core stone as well as on the flakes, either of which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ea_archaeology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080513213506/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including butchering carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[hides|hide]]; and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were crude, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;ea_archaeology&quot; /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[Lithic reduction#Pressure flaking|pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=0-534-62487-1|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire====
{{main|Control of fire by early humans}}
The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple [[energy]] source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Crump | first=Thomas | title=A Brief History of Science | year=2001 | publisher=[[Constable &amp; Robinson]] | isbn=1-84119-235-X | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the [[Cradle of Humankind]] suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=915 | title=Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and Environs | accessdate=2007-03-10 | publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholarly consensus indicates that [[Homo erectus]] had controlled fire by between 500,000&amp;nbsp;BC and 400,000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab10 | title=History of Stone Age Man | accessdate=2007-02-13 | publisher=History World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene | last=James | first=Steven R. | journal=[[Current Anthropology]] | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=1–26 | format=fee required | month=February | year=1989 | doi=10.1086/203705 | jstor=2743299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire, fueled with [[wood]] and [[charcoal]], allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stahl | first= Ann B. | year=1984 | title=Hominid dietary selection before fire | journal=[[Current Anthropology]] | volume=25 | pages= 151–168 | format=fee required | doi=10.1086/203106 | issue=2 | jstor=2742818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clothing and shelter====

Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380,000&amp;nbsp;BC, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_3.htm | title=Evolution of Modern Humans: Archaic Homo sapiens Culture | accessdate=2007-03-31 | author=O'Neil, Dennis | publisher=[[Palomar College]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Villa | first=Paola | year=1983 | title=Terra Amata and the Middle Pleistocene archaeological record of southern France| publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] | isbn= 0-520-09662-2 |page= 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to [[Historical migration|migrate]]

===Neolithic through classical antiquity (10,000BC – 300AD)===
[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]

Man's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] period (&quot;New stone age&quot;). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance because it allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. The discovery of [[agriculture]] allowed for the feeding of larger populations, and the transition to a [[sedentism|sedentist]] lifestyle increased the number of children that could be simultaneously raised, as young children no longer needed to be carried, as was the case with the nomadic lifestyle. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060103114116.htm|title=The First Baby Boom: Skeletal Evidence Shows Abrupt Worldwide Increase In Birth Rate During Neolithic Period|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|date=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Transport, Family Size, and Increase in Human Population During the Neolithic|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|author=Sussman, Robert W. |coauthors= Hall, Roberta L.|volume=13|issue=2| pages=258–267|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|month=April|year=1972|doi=10.1086/201274 |jstor=2740977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://books.google.com/?id=isGyuX9motEC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=labor+neolithic+population|title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|author=Ferraro, Gary P.|year=2006|isbn=0-495-03039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as [[Uruk]], and the first civilizations, such as [[Sumer]], is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] social structures, the specialization of labor, trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges, such as the building of [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] and [[reservoir]]s, are all thought to have played a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8pKKwlEcpwYC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=labor+surplus+neolithic+population|accessdate=2008-05-17|title=The ESSENTIALS of Ancient History|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|author=Patterson, Gordon M.|year=1992|isbn=978-0-87891-704-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metal tools====

Continuing improvements led to the [[furnace]] and [[bellows]] and provided the ability to [[smelting|smelt]] and [[forge]] native metals (naturally occurring in relatively pure form).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://neon.mems.cmu.edu/cramb/Processing/history.html | title=A Short History of Metals | accessdate=2007-01-08 | last=Cramb | first=Alan W | publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gold]], [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[lead]], were such early metals. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of [[Neolithic]] times (about 8000 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VANVAEjBG-QC&amp;pg=PA708|accessdate=2008-05-17|author= Chisholm, Hugh|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=1910|page=708|title=The Encyclopedia Britannica: A dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of [[alloys]] such as [[bronze]] and [[brass]] (about 4000 BC). The first uses of iron alloys such as [[steel]] dates to around 1400 BC.

====Energy and transport====
[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented circa 4000 BC.]]

Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dodge|first=Darrell|title=Part 1 - Early History Through 1875|url=http://www.telosnet.com/wind/early.html|work=Illustrated History of Wind Power Development|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of a ship under sail is shown on an Egyptian pot dating back to 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dollinger|first=André|title=Ships and Boats|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/navigation.htm|work=Pharaonic Egypt|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the Nile annual floods to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and 'catch' basins. Similarly, the early peoples of Mesopotamia, the Sumerians, learned to use the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for much the same purposes. But more extensive use of wind and water (and even human) power required another invention.

According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 B.C. probably independently and nearly-simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]), the Northern Caucasus ([[Maykop culture]]) and Central Europe. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 B.C., with most experts putting it closer to 4000 B.C. The oldest artifacts with drawings that depict wheeled carts date from about 3000 B.C.; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. There is also evidence from the same period of time that wheels were used for the production of [[Potter's wheel|pottery]]. (Note that the original potter's wheel was probably not a wheel, but rather an irregularly shaped slab of flat wood with a small hollowed or pierced area near the center and mounted on a peg driven into the earth. It would have been rotated by repeated tugs by the potter or his assistant.) More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/country/veneti/AmerDomoOldestWheel.html | title=Slovenian Marsh Yields World's Oldest Wheel | accessdate=2007-02-13 | publisher=Ameriška Domovina | date=2003-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the wheel revolutionized activities as disparate as transportation, war, and the production of pottery (for which it may have been first used). It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads and fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery. But it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources.

===Medieval and modern history (300 AD —)===
{{Main|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|Productivity improving technologies (historical)|Information Technology}}

Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology later took another step with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]] and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]], and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to the construction of [[skyscraper]]s and large cities whose inhabitants rely on [[automobile]]s or other powered transit for transportation. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[steam-powered ship]], [[train]], [[airplane]], and [[automobile]].

[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over a burning [[oil field]] in Kuwait in 1991.]]
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. The technology behind got called [[information technology]], and these advancements subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]], which ushered in the current [[Information Age]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments. Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to construct and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education — their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]] and [[architecture]].

==Technology and philosophy==

===Technicism===
Generally, [[technicism]] is a reliance or confidence in technology as a benefactor of society. Taken to extreme, technicism is the belief that humanity will ultimately be able to control the entirety of existence using technology. In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as [[Stephen V. Monsma]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsma 1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 0-8028-0175-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher [[moral authority]].

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Hughes, James| title = Democratic Transhumanism 2.0| year= 2002 | url = http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm| accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism and critics of technology===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the Luddites and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious, although not entirely deterministic reservations, about technology (see &quot;[[The Question Concerning Technology]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidegger 1977&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=2007-11-21 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 0-613-91314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)&quot;. According to Heidegger scholars [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa, &quot;Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology,'' in The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays, trans. W. Lovitt, New York, Harper Torchbooks, 1977, pp. 25–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, &quot;Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday,&quot; in Nikolas Kompridis, ed. ''Philosophical Romanticism'', New York: Routledge, 2006, 265-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics, for example [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' and other writings, [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. And, in ''[[Faust]]'' by [[Goethe]], Faust's selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world, is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction, such as those by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[William Gibson]], and films (e.g. [[Blade Runner]], [[Ghost in the Shell]]) project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.

The late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and, finally, what he called &quot;technopolies,&quot; that is, societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress, to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Postman, ''Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology'', New York: Vintage, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darin Barney has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;Darin Barney, ''One Nation Under Google'', Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]] and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf Nikolas Kompridis, &quot;Technology's Challenge to Democracy,&quot; ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 20-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.

Another, more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by [[Theodore Kaczynski]] (aka The [[Unabomber]]) and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure.

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]], however, was developed in the 20th century (e.g., see the work of [[Jacques Ellul]]) to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[eco-village]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.

==Technology and competitiveness==

In 1983 a classified program was initiated in the [[US intelligence community]] to reverse the US declining economic and military competitiveness.  The program, [[Project Socrates]], used all source intelligence to review competitiveness worldwide for all forms of competition to determine the source of the US decline.  What Project Socrates determined was that technology exploitation is the foundation of all [[competitive advantage]] and that the source of the US declining competitiveness was the fact that decision-making through the US both in the private and public sectors had switched from decision making that was based on technology exploitation (i.e., technology-based planning) to decision making that was based on money exploitation (i.e., economic-based planning) at the end of World War II.

Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.

Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[DuPont]], [[General Motors|GM]]) and it what was used to transform the US into a [[superpower]]. It was not economic-based planning.

Project Socrates determined that to rebuild US competitiveness, decision making throughout the US had to readopt technology-based planning.  Project Socrates also determined that countries like China and India had continued executing technology-based (while the US took its detour into economic-based) planning, and as a result had considerable advanced the process and were using it to build themselves into superpowers.  To rebuild US competitiveness the US decision-makers needed adopt a form of technology-based planning that was far more advanced than that used by China and India.

Project Socrates determined that technology-based planning makes an evolutionary leap forward every few hundred years and the next evolutionary leap, the Automated Innovation Revolution, was poised to occur.

A '''computer''' is a general purpose device that can be [[Computer program|programmed]] to carry out a finite set of arithmetic or logical operations. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.

Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and some form of [[memory (computers)|memory]]. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit that can change the order of operations based on stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.

The first electronic [[digital]] computers were developed between 1940 and 1945 in the United Kingdom and United States. Originally they were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern [[personal computer]]s (PCs).&lt;ref&gt;In 1946, [[ENIAC]] required an estimated 174&amp;nbsp;kW. By comparison, a modern laptop computer may use around 30&amp;nbsp;W; nearly six thousand times less.
{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/computing/provider/docs/hardware/powerusage.html|title=Approximate Desktop &amp; Notebook Power Usage|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this era [[mechanical computer|mechanical]] [[analog computers]] were used for military applications.

Modern computers based on [[integrated circuit]]s are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines, and occupy a fraction of the space.&lt;ref&gt;Early computers such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] and [[ENIAC]] were able to process between 5 and 100 operations per second. A modern “[[commodity]]” [[microprocessor]] (as of 2007) can process billions of operations per second, and many of these operations are more complicated and useful than early computer operations.

==History of computing==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|The [[Jacquard loom]], on display at the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]], England, was one of the first programmable devices.]]
{{Main|History of computing hardware}}

The first use of the word “computer” was recorded in 1613 in a book called “The yong mans gleanings” by English writer Richard Braithwait ''I haue read the truest computer of Times, and the best Arithmetician that euer breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number''. It referred to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. From the end of the 19th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, a machine that carries out computations.&lt;ref name=OEDComputer&gt;{{Cite document |title=computer, ''n.'' |series=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/ |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=2 |year=1989 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited-function early computers===
The history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies, automated calculation and programmability. However no single device can be identified as the earliest computer, partly because of the inconsistent application of that term. A few devices are worth mentioning though, like some mechanical aids to computing, which were very successful and survived for centuries until the advent of the [[electronic calculator]], like the [[Abacus#Mesopotamian|Sumerian abacus]], designed around 2500 BC&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book

Around the end of the 10th century, the French monk [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert d'Aurillac]] brought back from Spain the drawings of a machine invented by the [[Moors]] that answered either Yes or No to the questions it was asked.&lt;ref name=Felt-8&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|year=1916|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=8|url=http://www.archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich}} [[Dorr E.

Felt]]&lt;/ref&gt; a device that could perform all four arithmetic operations without relying on human intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;“Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures” [http://books.google.fr/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arithmometer&amp;f=false The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100]&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanical calculator was at the root of the development of computers in two separate ways. Initially, it was in trying to develop more powerful and more flexible calculators&lt;ref&gt;Babbage's [[Difference engine]] in 1823 and his [[Analytical engine]] in the mid-1830s&lt;/ref&gt; that the computer was first theorized by [[Charles Babbage]]&lt;ref&gt;“It is reasonable to inquire, therefore, whether it is possible to devise a machine which will do for mathematical computation what the automatic lathe has done for engineering. The first suggestion that such a machine could be made came more than a hundred years ago from the mathematician Charles Babbage. Babbage's ideas have only been properly appreciated in the last ten years, but we now realize that he understood clearly all the fundamental principles which are embodied in modern digital computers” ''Faster than thought'', edited by B. V. Bowden, 1953, Pitman publishing corporation
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“...Among this extraordinary galaxy of talent Charles Babbage appears to be one of the most remarkable of all. Most of his life he spent in an entirely unsuccessful attempt to make a machine which was regarded by his contemporaries as utterly preposterous, and his efforts were regarded as futile, time-consuming and absurd. In the last decade or so we have learnt how his ideas can be embodied in a modern digital computer. He understood more about the logic of these machines than anyone else in the world had learned until after the end of the last war.” Foreword, ''Irascible Genius, Charles Babbage, inventor'' by Maboth Moseley, 1964, London, Hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt; and then developed.&lt;ref&gt;In the proposal that Aiken gave IBM in 1937 while requesting funding for the [[Harvard Mark I]] we can read: “Few '''calculating machines''' have been designed strictly for application to scientific investigations, the notable exceptions being those of Charles Babbage and others who followed him&amp;nbsp;... After abandoning the difference engine, Babbage devoted his energy to the design and construction of an analytical engine of far higher powers than the difference engine&amp;nbsp;... Since the time of Babbage, the development of '''calculating machinery''' has continued at an increasing rate.” [[Howard Aiken]], ''Proposed automatic calculating machine'', reprinted in: The origins of Digital computers, Selected Papers, Edited by Brian Randell, 1973, ISBN 3-540-06169-X&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, development of a low-cost [[electronic calculator]], successor to the mechanical calculator, resulted in the development by [[Intel Corporation|Intel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/about/companyinfo/museum/exhibits/4004/index.htm |title=Intel Museum&amp;nbsp;– The 4004, Big deal then, Big deal now |publisher=Intel.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the first commercially available [[microprocessor]] integrated circuit.

===First general-purpose computers===
In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] made an improvement to the [[loom|textile loom]] by introducing a series of [[punched card|punched paper cards]] as a template which allowed his loom to weave intricate patterns automatically. The resulting Jacquard loom was an important step in the development of computers because the use of punched cards to define woven patterns can be viewed as an early, albeit limited, form of programmability.
[[File:Jacquard Joseph Marie woven silk.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;'''The Most Famous Image in the Early History of Computing'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Computers+%26+the+Human+Brain From cave paintings to the internet] HistoryofScience.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This portrait of Jacquard was woven in silk on a Jacquard loom and required 24,000 punched cards to create (1839). It was only produced to order. [[Charles Babbage]] owned one of these portraits; it inspired him in using perforated cards in his [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Anthony Hyman, ed., ''Science and Reform: Selected Works of Charles Babbage'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1989), page 298. It is in the collection of the Science Museum in London, England. (Delve (2007), page 99.)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Z3 Deutsches Museum.JPG|thumb|The [[Zuse Z3]], 1941, considered the world's first working programmable, fully automatic computing machine.]]
It was the fusion of automatic calculation with programmability that produced the first recognizable computers. In 1837, [[Charles Babbage]] was the first to conceptualize and design a fully programmable [[mechanical computer]], his [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;The analytical engine should not be confused with Babbage's [[difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; Limited finances and Babbage's inability to resist tinkering with the design meant that the device was never completed—nevertheless his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the ''mill'') in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906. This machine was given to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science museum in South Kensington]] in 1910.

In the late 1880s, [[Herman Hollerith]] invented the recording of data on a machine-readable medium. Earlier uses of machine-readable media had been for control, not data. “After some initial trials with [[Punched tape|paper tape]], he settled on punched cards...”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History: Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To process these punched cards he invented the [[tabulating machine|tabulator]], and the [[keypunch]] machines. These three inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry. Large-scale automated data processing of punched cards was performed for the [[1890 United States Census]] by Hollerith's company, which later became the core of [[IBM]]. By the end of the 19th century a number of ideas and technologies, that would later prove useful in the realization of practical computers, had begun to appear: [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], the [[vacuum tube]] (thermionic valve), punched cards and tape, and the [[teleprinter]].

During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific [[computing]] needs were met by increasingly sophisticated [[analog computer]]s, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for [[computation]]. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.

[[Alan Turing]] is widely regarded as the father of modern [[computer science]]. In 1936, Turing provided an influential formalization of the concept of the [[algorithm]] and [[computation]] with the [[Turing machine]], providing a blueprint for the electronic digital computer.&lt;ref name=DSW/&gt; Of his role in the creation of the modern computer, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in naming Turing one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential]] people of the 20th century, states: “The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.”&lt;ref name=DSW&gt;{{cite web

The first program-controlled computer was invented by [[Konrad Zuse]], who built the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], an electromechanical computing machine, in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/gadgets/0,1518,651776,00.html |title=Spiegel: The inventor of the computer's biography was published | work=Der Spiegel | date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first programmable electronic computer was the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], built in 1943 by [[Tommy Flowers]].

[[George Stibitz]] is internationally recognized as a father of the modern digital computer. While working at Bell Labs in November 1937, Stibitz invented and built a relay-based calculator he dubbed the “Model K” (for “kitchen table,” on which he had assembled it), which was the first to use [[Binary numeral system|binary]] circuits to perform [[Adder (electronics)|an arithmetic operation]]. Later models added greater sophistication including complex arithmetic and programmability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor Profile: George R. Stibitz|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame Foundation, Inc.|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/140.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A succession of steadily more powerful and flexible [[computing]] devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features that are seen in modern computers. The use of digital electronics (largely invented by [[Claude Shannon]] in 1937) and more flexible programmability were vitally important steps, but defining one point along this road as “the first digital electronic computer” is difficult.{{Ref|shannon1940|Shannon 1940|a}} Notable achievements include:

*[[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] “Z machines.” The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine featuring [[Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic, including floating point arithmetic and a measure of programmability. In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]], therefore being the world's first operational computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rojas |first=R. |title=How to make Zuse's Z3 a universal computer |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |volume=20 |pages=51–54 |year=1998 |doi=10.1109/85.707574 |issue=3|ref=harv |authorlink=Raúl Rojas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The non-programmable [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (commenced in 1937, completed in 1941) which used vacuum tube based [[computation]], binary numbers, and [[regenerative capacitor memory]]. The use of regenerative memory allowed it to be much more compact than its peers (being approximately the size of a large desk or workbench), since intermediate results could be stored and then fed back into the same set of computation elements.

It was used for [[cryptanalysis|breaking]] German wartime codes.

*The U.S. Army's [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] [[ENIAC]] (1946), which used [[decimal]] arithmetic and is sometimes called the first general purpose [[Electronics|electronic]] computer (since [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] of 1941 used [[electromagnet]]s instead of [[electronics]]). Initially, however, ENIAC had an architecture which required rewiring a [[plugboard]] to change its programming.

===Stored-program architecture===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Several developers of ENIAC, recognizing its flaws, came up with a far more flexible and elegant design, which came to be known as the “stored-program architecture” or [[von Neumann architecture]]. This design was first formally described by [[John von Neumann]] in the paper ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture commenced around this time, the first of which was completed in 1948 at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM or “Baby”). The [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC), completed a year after the SSEM at Cambridge University, was the first practical, non-experimental implementation of the stored-program design and was put to use immediately for research work at the university. Shortly thereafter, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—[[EDVAC]]—was completed but did not see full-time use for an additional two years.

Nearly all modern computers implement some form of the stored-program architecture, making it the single trait by which the word “computer” is now defined. While the technologies used in computers have changed dramatically since the first electronic, general-purpose computers of the 1940s, most still use the von Neumann architecture.
[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of an [[Intel 80486DX2]] [[microprocessor]] (actual size: 12×6.75&amp;nbsp;mm) in its packaging]]

Beginning in the 1950s, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientists [[Sergei Sobolev]] and [[Nikolay Brusentsov]] conducted research on [[ternary computer]]s, devices that operated on a base three numbering system of -1, 0, and 1 rather than the conventional [[binary number]]ing system upon which most computers are based. They designed the [[Setun]], a functional ternary computer, at [[Moscow State University]]. The device was put into limited production in the Soviet Union, but supplanted by the more common binary architecture.

===Semiconductors and microprocessors===
Computers using [[vacuum tube]]s as their electronic elements were in use throughout the 1950s, but by the 1960s they had been largely replaced by [[transistor]]-based machines, which were smaller, faster, cheaper to produce, required less power, and were more reliable. The first transistorized computer was demonstrated at the [[University of Manchester]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=LavingtonP37&gt;{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, [[integrated circuit]] technology and the subsequent creation of [[microprocessor]]s, such as the [[Intel 4004]], further decreased size and cost and further increased speed and reliability of computers. By the late 1970s, many products such as [[Videocassette recorder|video recorders]] contained dedicated computers called [[microcontroller]]s, and they started to appear as a replacement to mechanical controls in domestic appliances such as [[washing machine]]s. The 1980s witnessed [[home computer]]s and the now ubiquitous personal computer. With the evolution of the Internet, personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Modern [[smartphone]]s are fully programmable computers in their own right, and as of 2009 may well be the most common form of such computers in existence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Programs==
[[File:Alan Turing photo.jpg|thumb|[[Alan Turing]] was an influential computer scientist.]]
The defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be [[computer programming|programmed]]. That is to say that some type of [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] (the [[Computer program|program]]) can be given to the computer, and it will process them. Modern computers based on the [[von Neumann architecture]] often have machine code in the form of an [[imperative programming language]].

In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for [[word processor]]s and [[web browser]]s for example. A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second ([[FLOPS|gigaflops]]) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation. Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of [[programmer]]s years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors.

===Stored program architecture===
{{Main|Computer program|Computer programming}}
[[File:SSEM Manchester museum.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first [[stored-program computer]], at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Manchester, England]]
This section applies to most common [[RAM machine]]-based computers.

In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc. These instructions are read from the computer's [[Computer data storage|memory]] and are generally carried out ([[execution (computing)|executed]]) in the order they were given. However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there. These are called “jump” instructions (or [[Branch (computer science)|branches]]). Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen [[conditional (programming)|conditionally]] so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event. Many computers directly support [[subroutine]]s by providing a type of jump that “remembers” the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction.

Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the [[control flow|flow of control]] within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Comparatively, a person using a pocket [[calculator]] can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses. But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake. On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions. For example:
{{-}}
       mov No. 0, sum     ; set sum to 0
       mov No. 1, num     ; set num to 1
 loop: add num, sum    ; add num to sum
       add No. 1, num     ; add 1 to num
       cmp num, #1000  ; compare num to 1000
       ble loop        ; if num &lt;= 1000, go back to 'loop'
       halt            ; end of program. stop running

Once told to run this program, the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention. It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in about a millionth of a second.&lt;ref&gt;This program was written similarly to those for the [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputer]] and shows some typical things a computer can do. All the text after the semicolons are [[Comment (computer programming)|comments]] for the benefit of human readers. These have no significance to the computer and are ignored. {{harv|Digital Equipment Corporation|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bugs===
{{Main|Software bug}}
[[File:H96566k.jpg|thumb|The actual first computer bug, a moth found trapped on a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer]]
Errors in computer programs are called “[[Software bug|bugs]].” They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects. But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to “[[Hang (computing)|hang]],” becoming unresponsive to input such as [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to [[Crash (computing)|crash]]. Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]], code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution. Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer. Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design.&lt;ref&gt;It is not universally true that bugs are solely due to programmer oversight. Computer hardware may fail or may itself have a fundamental problem that produces unexpected results in certain situations. For instance, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] caused some [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[microprocessor]]s in the early 1990s to produce inaccurate results for certain [[floating point]] division operations. This was caused by a flaw in the microprocessor design and resulted in a partial recall of the affected devices.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grace Hopper]] is credited for having first used the term “bugs” in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the [[Harvard Mark II]] computer in September 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;taylor84&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Machine code===
In most computers, individual instructions are stored as [[machine code]] with each instruction being given a unique number (its operation code or [[opcode]] for short). The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode, the command to multiply them would have a different opcode and so on. The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code. Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes. This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data. The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture. In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on. This is called the [[Harvard architecture]] after the [[Harvard Mark I]] computer. Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in [[CPU cache]]s.

While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers ([[machine code|machine language]]) and while this technique was used with many early computers,&lt;ref&gt;Even some later computers were commonly programmed directly in machine code. Some [[minicomputer]]s like the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-8]] could be programmed directly from a panel of switches. However, this method was usually used only as part of the [[booting]] process. Most modern computers boot entirely automatically by reading a boot program from some [[non-volatile memory]].&lt;/ref&gt; it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember&amp;nbsp;– a [[mnemonic]] such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's [[assembly language]]. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1970s [[punched card]] containing one line from a [[Fortran|FORTRAN]] program. The card reads: “Z(1) = Y + W(1)” and is labeled “PROJ039” for identification purposes.]]

===Programming language===
{{Main|Programming language}}
Programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run. Unlike [[natural language]]s, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise. They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud. They are generally either translated into [[machine code]] by a [[compiler]] or an [[assembler (computer programming)|assembler]] before being run, or translated directly at run time by an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]]. Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.

====Low-level languages====
{{Main|Low-level programming language}}
Machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them (collectively termed ''low-level programming languages'') tend to be unique to a particular type of computer. For instance, an [[ARM architecture]] computer (such as may be found in a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or a [[handheld video game|hand-held videogame]]) cannot understand the machine language of an [[Pentium|Intel Pentium]] or the [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] computer that might be in a [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;However, there is sometimes some form of machine language compatibility between different computers. An [[x86-64]] compatible microprocessor like the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Athlon 64]] is able to run most of the same programs that an [[Intel Core 2]] microprocessor can, as well as programs designed for earlier microprocessors like the Intel [[Pentium]]s and [[Intel 80486]]. This contrasts with very early commercial computers, which were often one-of-a-kind and totally incompatible with other computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Higher-level languages====
{{Main|High-level programming language}}
Though considerably easier than in machine language, writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone. Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract [[high-level programming language]]s that are able to express the needs of the [[programmer]] more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error). High level languages are usually “compiled” into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a [[compiler]].&lt;ref&gt;High level languages are also often [[interpreted language|interpreted]] rather than compiled. Interpreted languages are translated into machine code on the fly, while running, by another program called an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].&lt;/ref&gt; High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program. It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer. This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various [[video game console]]s.

===Program design===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
Program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem, collection of inputs, using the programming constructs within languages, devising or using established procedures and algorithms, providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable. As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered. Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large [[Computer software|software]] systems presents a significant intellectual challenge. Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of [[software engineering]] concentrates specifically on this challenge.

==Components==
{{Main|Central processing unit|Microprocessor}}
A general purpose computer has four main components: the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), the [[control unit]], the [[Computer data storage|memory]], and the input and output devices (collectively termed I/O). These parts are interconnected by [[bus (computing)|buses]], often made of groups of [[wire]]s.

Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small [[electrical network|electrical circuits]] which can be turned off or on by means of an [[transistor|electronic switch]]. Each circuit represents a [[bit]] (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a “1”, and when off it represents a “0” (in positive logic representation). The circuits are arranged in [[logic gate]]s so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.

The control unit, ALU, registers, and basic I/O (and often other hardware closely linked with these) are collectively known as a [[central processing unit]] (CPU). Early CPUs were composed of many separate components but since the mid-1970s CPUs have typically been constructed on a single [[integrated circuit]] called a ''[[microprocessor]]''.

===Control unit===
{{Main|CPU design|Control unit}}
[[File:Mips32 addi.svg|thumb|260px|right|Diagram showing how a particular [[MIPS architecture]] instruction would be decoded by the control system.]]

The control unit (often called a control system or central controller) manages the computer's various components; it reads and interprets (decodes) the program instructions, transforming them into a series of control signals which activate other parts of the computer.&lt;ref&gt;The control unit's role in interpreting instructions has varied somewhat in the past. Although the control unit is solely responsible for instruction interpretation in most modern computers, this is not always the case. Many computers include some instructions that may only be partially interpreted by the control system and partially interpreted by another device. This is especially the case with specialized computing hardware that may be partially self-contained. For example, [[EDVAC]], one of the earliest stored-program computers, used a central control unit that only interpreted four instructions. All of the arithmetic-related instructions were passed on to its arithmetic unit and further decoded there.&lt;/ref&gt; Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of some instructions so as to improve performance.

A key component common to all CPUs is the [[program counter]], a special memory cell (a [[processor register|register]]) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from.&lt;ref&gt;Instructions often occupy more than one memory address, therefore the program counter usually increases by the number of memory locations required to store one instruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system's function is as follows—note that this is a simplified description, and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of CPU:

# Read the code for the next instruction from the cell indicated by the program counter.
# Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
# Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
# Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device). The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
# Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
# If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation.
# Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
# Jump back to step (1).

Since the program counter is (conceptually) just another set of memory cells, it can be changed by calculations done in the ALU. Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program. Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as “jumps” and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of [[control flow]]).

The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a [[microsequencer]], which runs a [[microcode]] program that causes all of these events to happen.

===Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)===
{{Main|Arithmetic logic unit}}

The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, [[trigonometry]] functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and [[square root]]s. Some can only operate on whole numbers ([[integer]]s) whilst others use [[floating point]] to represent [[real number]]s, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform. Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation. An ALU may also compare numbers and return [[Truth value|boolean truth values]] (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (“is 64 greater than 65?”).

Logic operations involve [[Boolean logic]]: [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[logical disjunction|OR]], [[Exclusive or|XOR]] and [[Negation|NOT]]. These can be useful for creating complicated [[conditional (programming)|conditional statements]] and processing [[boolean logic]].

[[Superscalar]] computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Memory===
{{Main|Computer data storage}}
[[File:Magnetic core.jpg|thumb|right|[[Magnetic core memory]] was the computer memory of choice throughout the 1960s, until it was replaced by semiconductor memory.]]

A computer's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read. Each cell has a numbered “address” and can store a single number. The computer can be instructed to “put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357” or to “add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595.” The information stored in memory may represent practically anything. Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease. Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers.

In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store [[binary numeral system|binary numbers]] in groups of eight bits (called a [[byte]]). Each byte is able to represent 256 different numbers (2^8 = 256); either from 0 to 255 or −128 to +127. To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight). When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in [[two's complement]] notation. Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts. A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically. Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.

The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called [[Processor register|registers]] that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area. There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU. Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed. As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed.

Computer main memory comes in two principal varieties: [[random-access memory]] or RAM and [[read-only memory]] or ROM. RAM can be read and written to anytime the CPU commands it, but ROM is preloaded with data and software that never changes, therefore the CPU can only read from it. ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions. In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely. In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the [[BIOS]] that orchestrates loading the computer's [[operating system]] from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset. In [[embedded system|embedded computers]], which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM. Software stored in ROM is often called [[firmware]], because it is notionally more like hardware than software. [[Flash memory]] blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable. It is typically much slower than conventional ROM and RAM however, so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Flash memory also may only be rewritten a limited number of times before wearing out, making it less useful for heavy random access usage. {{harv|Verma &amp; Mielke|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more sophisticated computers there may be one or more RAM [[CPU cache|cache memories]], which are slower than registers but faster than main memory. Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part.

===Input/output (I/O)===

===Multitasking===
{{Main|Computer multitasking}}
While a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory, in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously. This is achieved by multitasking i.e. having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an [[interrupt]], which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead. By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later. If several programs are running “at the same time,” then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time. Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant. This method of multitasking is sometimes termed “time-sharing” since each program is allocated a “slice” of time in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the era of cheap computers, the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer.

Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks. If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a “time slice” until the event it is waiting for has occurred. This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.

===Multiprocessing===
{{Main|Multiprocessing}}
[[File:Cray 2 Arts et Metiers dsc03940.jpg|thumb|[[Cray]] designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily.]]
Some computers are designed to distribute their work across several CPUs in a multiprocessing configuration, a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as [[supercomputer]]s, [[mainframe computer]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. Multiprocessor and [[multi-core]] (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result.

Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general purpose computers.&lt;ref&gt;However, it is also very common to construct supercomputers out of many pieces of cheap commodity hardware; usually individual computers connected by networks. These so-called [[computer cluster]]s]] can often provide supercomputer performance at a much lower cost than customized designs. While custom architectures are still used for most of the most powerful supercomputers, there has been a proliferation of cluster computers in recent years. {{harv|TOP500|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware. Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once. Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|graphics rendering]], and [[cryptography]] applications, as well as with other so-called “[[embarrassingly parallel]]” tasks.

===Networking and the Internet===
{{Main|Computer networking|Internet}}
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|left|Visualization of a portion of the [[Routing|routes]] on the Internet.]]
Computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the 1950s. The U.S. military's [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] system was the first large-scale example of such a system, which led to a number of special-purpose commercial systems such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now [[DARPA]]), and the [[computer network]] that resulted was called the [[ARPANET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Internet|url=http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml|publisher=[[Internet Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.

In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the [[World Wide Web]], combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like [[Ethernet]] and [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL]] saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. “Wireless” networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

===Computer architecture paradigms===
There are many types of [[computer architecture]]s:
* [[Quantum computer]] vs [[Chemical computer]]
* [[Scalar processor]] vs [[Vector processor]]
* [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) computers
* [[Register machine]] vs [[Stack machine]]
* [[Harvard architecture]] vs [[von Neumann architecture]]
* [[Cellular architecture]]

The quantum computer architecture holds the most promise to revolutionize computing.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWaUurOwMPQC&amp;q=quantum+computers&amp;dq=insufficient+address+computer+architecture&amp;source=gbs_word_cloud_r&amp;cad=3#v=snippet&amp;q=quantum%20computers&amp;f=false &quot;Computer architecture: fundamentals and principles of computer design&quot;] by Joseph D. Dumas 2006. page 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Logic gates]] are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above [[digital]] or [[analog signal|analog]] paradigms.

The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called [[Computer program|programs]] makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from [[calculator]]s. The [[Church–Turing thesis]] is a mathematical statement of this versatility: any computer with a [[Turing-complete|minimum capability (being Turing-complete)]] is, in principle, capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform. Therefore any type of computer ([[netbook]], [[supercomputer]], [[cellular automaton]], etc.) is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity.

==Misconceptions==
A computer does not need to be [[electronics|electronic]], nor even have a [[Central processing unit|processor]], nor [[RAM]], nor even a [[hard disk]]. While popular usage of the word “computer” is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (6th ed, 2007), the word ''computer'' dates back to the mid 17th century, when it referred to “A person who makes calculations; specifically a person employed for this in an observatory etc.”&lt;/ref&gt; definition of a computer is literally “''A device that computes'', especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefreedictionary.com/computer |title=Definition of computer|publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any device which ''processes information'' qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful.

===Required technology===
{{Main|Unconventional computing}}
Historically, computers evolved from [[mechanical computer]]s and eventually from [[vacuum tube]]s to [[transistor]]s. However, conceptually computational systems as [[Turing complete|flexible]] as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything. For example, a computer can be made out of billiard balls ([[billiard ball computer]]); an often quoted example.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} More realistically, modern computers are made out of [[transistors]] made of [[photolithography|photolithographed]] [[semiconductors]].

There is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology, such as [[optical computing|optical computers]], [[DNA computing|DNA computers]], [[wetware computer|neural computers]], and [[quantum computing|quantum computers]]. Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any [[computable function]], and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed. However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by [[Shor's algorithm|quantum factoring]]) very quickly.

*[[Glossary of computers]]

===Artificial intelligence===
A computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to, without regard to efficiency, alternative solutions, possible shortcuts, or possible errors in the code. Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]].

===Hardware===
{{main|Computer hardware|Personal computer hardware}}
The term ''hardware'' covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible objects. Circuits, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and mice are all hardware.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the '''natural world''', '''physical world''', or '''material world'''. &quot;Nature&quot; refers to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to [[life]] in general. It ranges in scale from the [[subatomic]] to the [[universe|cosmic]].

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or &quot;essential qualities, innate disposition&quot;, and in ancient times, literally meant &quot;birth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline-nature&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' was a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;A useful though somewhat erratically presented account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press, 2006. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage was confirmed during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, and reflects the then-current use of the words &quot;[[natural philosophy]]&quot;, akin to &quot;systematic study of nature&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word &quot;physical&quot; shows its use as a synonym for &quot;natural&quot; in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, &quot;nature&quot; often refers to [[geology]] and [[wildlife]]. Nature may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the [[weather]] and [[geology]] of the Earth, and the [[matter]] and [[energy]] of which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the &quot;[[natural environment]]&quot; or [[wilderness]]–wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, &quot;human nature&quot; or &quot;the whole of nature&quot;. This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term &quot;natural&quot; might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]], the [[supernatural]], or [[Artifact (archaeology)|synthetic]].

[[Earth]] (or, &quot;the earth&quot;) is the only [[planet]] presently known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]].

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|right|300px|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
Geology is the [[science]] and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dike]]s, and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] which broke apart about 540&amp;nbsp;million years ago, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart about 180&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Murphy |coauthors=R.D.

There is significant evidence that a severe [[Glacier|glacial]] action during the [[Neoproterozoic]] era covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice. This hypothesis has been termed the &quot;[[Snowball Earth]]&quot;, and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |year=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margulis1995&quot; /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}

The atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], carbon dioxide, etc.; but air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]]. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude, and has a [[scale height]] of about 8 kilometres at the Earth's surface: the height at which the atmospheric pressure has declined by a factor of ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (a mathematical constant
equal to 2.71...).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat. [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in [[temperature]] between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.

Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

The planetary climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the planet's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.

The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the [[seasons]], which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is currently limited to only a few days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Overall, two things are currently happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===

{{Five oceans}}
{{Main|Ocean}}

An [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface]] (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]&quot;. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNAoO&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet]&quot;. ''[http://www.oceansatlas.com/ UN Atlas of the Oceans]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to [[oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;Spilhaus, Athelstan F. 1942 (Jul.). &quot;Maps of the whole world ocean.&quot; ''Geographical Review'' ([[American Geographical Society]]). Vol. 32 (3): pp. 431–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Southern Ocean]] and the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Smaller regions of the oceans are called [[sea]]s, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}

A [[lake]] (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of [[liquid]] on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the [[ocean]], is larger and deeper than a [[pond]], and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lake a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of [[ethane]], most likely mixed with [[methane]]. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven microcurrents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}

A [[river]] is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster.

In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including [[stream]], creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=river&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h= River]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}, Wordnet&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – faqs], #17 What is the difference between [[mountain]], [[hill]], and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; [[lake]] and [[pond]]; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky [[stream]] in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}

A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the [[United States]] a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for [[fish]] and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitat]]s and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]] and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.

Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: &quot;Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the &quot;community&quot;) in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odum1971&quot;&gt;Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange [[energy]] and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The human ecosystem concept is grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |year=2004 |month=April |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. [http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ The WILD Foundation] goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: &quot;The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet – those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.&quot; Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s and even in [[urban area]]s along rivers, gulches or otherwise [[undeveloped area]]s. [http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ Wilderness areas] and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name=&quot;Man p155-157&quot;&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155-157, ISBN 1559634650.&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Ecologist]]s consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the planet's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}

Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year = 2006|url = http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php|title = Definition of Life|publisher = California Academy of Sciences|accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms ([[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). Currently the entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram]]s) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure &quot;about one-half of one percent&quot; takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |year=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities : sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=0-88936-882-1}}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5 billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390 billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455 billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter V. |last=Sengbusch |title=The Flow of Energy in Ecosystems – Productivity, Food Chain, and Trophic Level |work=Botany online |publisher=University of Hamburg Department of Biology |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e54/54c.htm |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |year=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Species Diversity and Biodiversity |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9h.html |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/thomas.wolosz/howmanysp.htm |title=How Many Species are There? |work=Extinction Web Page Class Notes |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Animal.&quot; World Book Encyclopedia. 16 vols.

{{Main|Evolution}}
Life is only known to exist on the planet Earth.(cf [[Astrobiology]]) The [[origin of life]] is still a poorly understood process, but it is thought to have occurred about 3.9 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago during the [[hadean]] or [[archean]] eons on a primordial earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.&lt;ref name=Line&gt;{{cite journal|author = Line M|title = The enigma of the origin of life and its timing|url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/148/1/21?view=long&amp;pmid=11782495|journal = Microbiology|volume = 148|issue = Pt 1|pages = 21–7|date=1 January 2002| pmid = 11782495}}&lt;/ref&gt; These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits. Once life had appeared, the process of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the [[fossil]] record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and [[DNA]] evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.&lt;ref name=Line/&gt;

The advent of [[photosynthesis]] in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy to be harvested to create conditions allowing for more complex life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The resultant [[oxygen]] accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the [[ozone layer]].

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]

Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying [[plants]] are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of &quot;native flora&quot; actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize &quot;useless&quot; plants, the informal use of the word &quot;weeds&quot; to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

[[Animal]]s as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from [[plant]]s and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions, most notably the [[sea sponge|sponges]] (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies differentiated into separate [[biological tissue|tissues]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule]]s, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

==Human interrelationship==

[[File:Dendrarium Sochi Mauritanian arbour.jpg|thumb|[[Sochi]] dendrarium is an example of confluence of &quot;natural&quot; and a &quot;made&quot; environment]]

Although humans currently comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and &quot;made environments&quot; is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is presently diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops In Global Climate Change Point To A Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include [[pollution]], [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains the primary component of the world's economic system. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some activities, such as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to [[energy]], nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|year = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = 2006-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]

[[Beauty]] in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much [[art]], [[photography]], [[poetry]] and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, is studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a range of opinions, see: {{cite web |url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006}} and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s analysis of the subject: {{cite book |last=Emerson |first=Ralph Waldo |year=1849 |title=Nature; Addresses and Lectures |chapter=Beauty |chapterurl=http://www.emersoncentral.com/beauty.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various [[era]]s of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in [[China]] during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, &quot;The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=1608192164| year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]

{{Main|Matter|Energy}}

Some fields of [[science]] see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be &quot;[[physics]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 23 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 73 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm/mr_limits.html |title=Some Theories Win, Some Lose |work=[[WMAP]] Mission: First Year Results |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=29 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of these components is still unknown and is currently under intensive investigation by physicists.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|year = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = 2007-01-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that appear to be static across the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Varshalovich, D. A.; Potekhin, A. Y. and Ivanchik, A.

==Beyond Earth==

{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}

Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the planet Earth is currently the only known body within the solar system to support life, current evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |coauthors=''et al.''|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–4|year = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = 2005-03-08|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = The Brown University News Bureau |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Scott Turner|date = 1998-03-02|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = The Brown University News Bureau |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the team of [[Stéphane Udry]] have discovered a new planet named [[Gliese 581 g]], which is an [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting the [[red dwarf]] [[star]] [[Gliese 581]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Gliese 581 g appears to lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding the [[star]], and therefore could possibly host [[life]] as we know it.

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] and the products of those activities; this article focuses primarily on the [[visual arts]], which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], [[photography]], and other visual media. [[Architecture]] is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential—in a way that they are usually not for a painting, for example. [[Music]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], and other [[performing arts]], as well as [[literature]], and other media such as [[interactive media]] are included in a broader definition of art or [[the arts]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Art, n. 1&quot;.

Art has been characterized in terms of [[mimesis]], expression, communication of emotion, or other values. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as &quot;a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |work=The Gombrich Archive| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definition of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html What Is Art?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and creation through imaginative or technical skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/630806/art art - Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of art, and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of [[philosophy]] known as [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed{{clarify|date=May 2012}}, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy : readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, pp. xi–xiii. ISBN 0-312-05391-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative art and fine art ==

{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song Dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

By a broad definition of art,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as [[human]]kind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James &quot;Art History and Images That Are Not Art&quot;, ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (Dec. 1995), with previous bibliography. &quot;Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value&quot;. 553&lt;/ref&gt; The first and broadest sense of ''art'' is the one that has remained closest to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to &quot;skill&quot; or &quot;craft.&quot; A few examples where this meaning proves very broad include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''[[Medicine|medical]] arts'', and ''[[military]] arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|240px|20th-century [[Rwanda]]n bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

In medieval philosophy, [[John Chrysostom]] held that &quot;the name of art should be applied to those only which contribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life.&quot; [[Thomas Aquinas]], when treating the adornment of women, gives an [[ethics|ethical]] justification as to why: &quot;In the case of an art directed to the production of goods which men cannot use without sin, it follows that the workmen sin in making such things, as directly affording others an occasion of sin; for instance, if a man were to make idols or anything pertaining to idolatrous worship. But in the case of an art the products of which may be employed by man either for a good or for an evil use, such as swords, arrows, and the like, the practice of such an art is not sinful. These alone should be called arts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Modesty in the outward apparel (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 169)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas held that art is nothing else than &quot;the right reason about certain works to be made,&quot; and that it is commendable, not for the will with which a craftman does a work, &quot;but for the quality of the work. Art, therefore, properly speaking, is an operative habit.&quot; [[Aristotle]] and Aquinas distinguish it from the related habit of [[prudence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2057.htm#article3 SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The intellectual virtues (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 57)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and more recent sense of the word ''art'' is as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' and emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]. ''[[Oxford University Press]]'', Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist's [[creativity]], or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of the ''finer'' things.

The word ''art'' can refer to several things: a study of creative skill, a process of using the creative skill, a product of the creative skill, or the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines that produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the viewer to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. Although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the &quot;creation&quot; of something new, this represents science only and is not categorized as art.

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and [[design]] are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, &quot;The Boundaries of Art&quot;, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of [[beauty]] (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as &quot;one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p.1, 2nd edn, 1980, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-29706-0&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] defined art as an ''other'' resp. a ''second [[nature]]'', according to his ideal of a [[Style (visual arts)|style]] founded on the basic fundaments of insight and on the innermost character of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Robert Mandelkow]], Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe. 2. edition. Vol. 1: Briefe der Jahre 1764-1786. ''Christian Wegner'', Hamburg 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;487 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name=Levinson5&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford university Press, 2003, p5. ISBN 0-19-927945-4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford university Press, 2003, p16. ISBN 0-19-927945-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], &quot;The Origin of the Work of Art&quot;, in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], &quot;Cézanne's Doubt&quot; in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as &quot;the [[art world]]&quot; has conferred &quot;the status of candidate for appreciation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. ISBN 0-312-05391-6&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as &quot;not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old.”&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003.

Sculptures, [[cave paintings]], rock paintings and [[petroglyphs]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] dating to roughly 40,000 years ago have been found, but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them. The oldest art objects in the world—a series of tiny, drilled snail shells about 75,000 years old—were discovered in a South African cave.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Tim. &quot;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/artsandhumanities/story/0,12241,1193237,00.html World's Oldest Jewellery Found in Cave]&quot;.

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of Biblical and religious truths, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on geometric patterns, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]]. Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang Dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming Dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or [[Jacques Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.

The history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[Impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art, such as Pablo Picasso being influenced by [[African art|African sculpture]]. Japanese woodblock prints (which had themselves been influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on Impressionism and subsequent development. Later, African sculptures were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, the west has had huge impacts on Eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries, with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles.

Modernism, the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability.  [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, &quot;It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony. Furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than regional cultures.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
{{Main|The arts}}
[[File:MonaLisa sfumato.jpeg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Mona Lisa]], showing the painting technique of ''[[sfumato]]'']]
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, each related to its technique, or [[Media (arts)|medium]], such as [[decorative art]]s, [[plastic arts]], [[performing arts]], or [[literature]]. Unlike scientific fields, art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique [http://www.rchoetzlein.com/quanta/theory/theory-new-media.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}. An artistic [[recording medium|medium]] is the substance or material the artistic work is made from, and may also refer to the technique used. For example, paint is a medium used in painting, and paper is a medium used in drawing.

An '''''art form''''' is the specific ''shape'', or quality an artistic expression takes. The media used often influence the form. For example, the [[shape|form]] of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions, and respond to gravity. The constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its '''''formal qualities'''''. To give another example, the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture, color, and brush texture. The formal qualities of video games are non-linearity, interactivity and virtual presence.
The ''form'' of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media, and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are related to content rather than form.&lt;ref name=SaylorIntroPDF&gt;{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 1: Introduction and Definitions|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-1.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''genre''''' is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium. For instance, well recognized genres in film are [[Western (genre)|western]], [[horror (genre)|horror]] and [[romantic comedy film|romantic comedy]]. Genres in music include [[death metal]] and [[trip hop]]. Genres in painting include [[still life]] and [[Landscape art|pastoral landscape]]. A particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions, clichés and tropes. (One note: the word ''genre'' has a second older meaning within painting; ''[[genre painting]]'' was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way.)

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]] by [[Hokusai]] (Japanese, 1760–1849), colored woodcut print]]
[[Image:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tomkins, p. 186&quot;&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''style''''' of an artwork, artist, or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art. Any loose brushy, dripped or poured abstract painting is called ''expressionistic''. Often a style is linked with a particular historical period, set of ideas, and particular artistic movement. So [[Jackson Pollock]] is called an [[Abstract Expressionist]].

A particular style may have specific cultural meanings. For example, [[Roy Lichtenstein]]—a painter associated with the American [[Pop art]] movement of the 1960s—was not a [[Pointillism|pointillist]], despite his use of dots. Lichtenstein used evenly spaced [[Ben-Day dots]] (the type used to reproduce color in comic strips) as a style to question the &quot;high&quot; art of painting with the &quot;low&quot; art of comics, thus commenting on class distinctions in culture. Pointillism, a technique in late Impressionism (1880s) developed especially by the artist [[Georges Seurat]], employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color. Both artists use dots, but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist.

These are all ways of beginning to define a work of art, to narrow it down. &quot;Imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks. How would you proceed with your task? One way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object, image video, or event. The decision to cast a sculpture in bronze, for instance, inevitably effects its meaning; the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate, even if everything else about the artwork remains the same. Next, you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes, colors, textures, and lines. These, in turn, are organized into various patterns and compositional structures. In your interpretation, you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork. [But in the end] the meaning of most artworks... is not exhausted by a discussion of materials, techniques, and form. Most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 4. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skill and craft===

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art], Signs – International Journal of Semiotics 3, pp.1–28, 2010. ISSN: 1902-8822&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] &quot;art&quot;, particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.

A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s &quot;[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]&quot; is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (&quot;ready-made&quot;) and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the [[mass media]]. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal holllow log tomb.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]
{{Off-topic|Art_(disambiguation)|date=November 2010}}
Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as &quot;that meal was a work of art&quot; (the cook is an artist), or &quot;the art of deception&quot;, (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity.

Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, &quot;good&quot; art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of [[3rd of May|3rd&amp;nbsp;of May]] 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''.

Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Graham | first1 = Gordon | title = Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of art==
[[File:Transition 1880.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Navajo rug]] made ''circa'' 1880]]

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is &quot;vague&quot;, but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Levi-Strauss).

===Non-motivated functions of art===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.
# ''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].'' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.&quot; -Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. The Poetics, Republic. Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively. http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Experience of the mysterious.'' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.&quot; -Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. The World as I See It. http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Expression of the imagination.'' Art provide a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else – something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken.&quot; -Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, Critique of Aesthetic Judgement (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.'' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'.&quot; -Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, &quot;Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context&quot;: (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions of art===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) to sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.
# ''Communication.'' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication.&quot; -Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art as entertainment''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.
# ''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.'' One of the defining functions of early twentieth century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—Dadaism, Surrealism, Russian Constructivism, and Abstract Expressionism, among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life.&quot; -André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, Surrealist Manifesto (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Art for psychological and healing purposes.'' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.
# ''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.'' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|700px|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# ''Art for social causes.'' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Jeramia|title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art|url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-  raising-autism-awareness-art/52165|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=WMC tv|date=2/15/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism|url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-  c9c0798815a2.html|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=Daily News-Miner|date=4/4/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism|url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_ autism_PR033111.pdf|publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services|accessdate=2/21/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruhl|first=Ashleigh|title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness|url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-  seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-  11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=Gazettes|date=2/18/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-  awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=The Palm Beach Post|date=no date given}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flynn|first=Marella|title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer|url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-  money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle|date=10/1/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking|url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-  raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News|date=11/26/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize|url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-  raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3|date=10/1/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SciCafe - Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness|url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-  conservation-awareness|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|accessdate=2/21/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur'|url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp|accessdate=2/21/2003|newspaper=SMU News Release|date=4/3/2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donnelly|first=Greg|title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women|url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise  +awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal  +women/6442594504/story.html|accessdate=2/21/2013|newspaper=Global Edmonton|date=3/5/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml|publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|accessdate=2/21/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathema|first=Paavan|title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# ''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.'' Art is often utilized as a form of [[propaganda]], and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], Mythologies&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Art as a fitness indicator.'' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dutton&quot;&gt;Dutton, Denis. 2003. 'Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology' in &quot;The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics&quot;. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.  Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]], though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]]. Once [[coin]]s were widely used these also became an artform that reached the widest range of society.  Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-coloured, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.  [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.  Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans_Collection#Collection_in_Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible.  The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753.  The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.  The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in [[Madrid]] was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], [[Munich]] and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist — On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is &quot;necessary to present something more than mere objects&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys|journal=ArtForum|date=December 1969|first=Willoughby|last=Sharp|coauthors=|volume=8|issue=4|page=45|id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. &quot;Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality, page 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mia | last=Fineman | coauthors= | title=YouTube for ArtistsThe best places to find video art online. | date=2007-03-21 | publisher= | url =http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ | work =Slate | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-03 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. &quot;With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980, page 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Géricault - La zattera della Medusa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial.  Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public.  The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].  [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and econonomic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance.  Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''[[Portrait of Madame X|Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam&amp;nbsp;X)]]'' (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century.  In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.

==Theory==
{{main|Aesthetics}}
In the nineteenth century, artists were primarily concerned with ideas of ''truth'' and ''[[beauty]]''. The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth.&quot; [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. [[Modern Painters]], Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, Essay VI. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; N.Y.,1999. ISBN 0-415-06700-6&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article &quot;Modernist Painting&quot; defines modern art as &quot;the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Frascina&quot;&gt;Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of
painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = &quot;Frascina&quot; /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchamp Interview Clip&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haon2DXWvLk Duchamp Two Statements - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. [[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]] is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. [[Fine Art]]. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included [[painting]], [[sculpting]] and [[music]] but also; [[cooking]], [[medicine]], [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]] and [[farming]] etc.

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|[[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]], 1917]]
Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art.

Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the [[movies]], superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon, &quot;2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art&quot;, New York Times, Magazine Section, December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, &quot;the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life&quot; are &quot;so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art&quot; (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the [[Daily Mail]] criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing &quot;For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all&quot; they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. &quot;Contemporary Art and the Home&quot;. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. ISBN 1-85973-661-0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that &quot;the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis ''[http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm Tribal Art]'' in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur. &quot;Artifact and Art.&quot; In Art/Artifact, edited by Susan Vogel. New York, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-art]] is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art;&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; it is term associated with [[Dada]]ism and attributed to [[Marcel Duchamp]] just before World War I,&lt;ref name=tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=571 &quot;Glossary: Anti-art&quot;], [[Tate]].

&lt;!-- The Internet and the WWW are different concepts – please do not muddle them in this article --&gt;
The '''Internet''' is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s that use the standard [[Internet protocol suite]] (''TCP/IP'') to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) and the [[information infrastructure|infrastructure]] to support email.

Most traditional communications media including telephone, music, film, and television are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) and [[Internet Protocol Television]] (IPTV). Newspaper, book and other print publishing are adapting to [[Web site]] technology, or are reshaped into [[blogging]] and [[web feed]]s. The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through [[instant messaging]], Internet forums, and [[social network service|social networking]]. [[Online shopping]] has boomed both for major retail outlets and small [[artisan]]s and traders. [[Business-to-business]] and [[financial services]] on the Internet affect [[supply chain]]s across entire industries.

The origins of the Internet reach back to research commissioned by the [[United States government]] in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks. The funding of a new U.S. [[Internet backbone|backbone]] by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The [[commercialization]] of what was by the 1990s an international network resulted in its popularization and incorporation into virtually every aspect of modern human life. {{As of|2012|6}}, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the [[world population|world's human population]]—have used the services of the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Stats|date=June 30, 2012|work=Internet World Stats|publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has no centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies. Only the overreaching definitions of the two principal [[name space]]s in the Internet, the [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] space and the [[Domain Name System]], are directed by a maintainer organization, the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Internet capitalization conventions}}
The ''Internet'', referring to the specific global system of interconnected [[Internet protocol|IP]] networks, is a [[proper noun]] and written with an initial [[capital letter]]. In the media and common use it is often not capitalized, viz. ''the internet.'' Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as a verb or an adjective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/ch07/ch07_sec076.html?para= &quot;7.76 Terms like 'web' and 'Internet'&quot;], ''Chicago Manual of Style'', University of Chicago, 16th edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is also often referred to as ''the Net''.

Historically the word ''internet'' was used, uncapitalized, as early as 1883 as a verb and adjective to refer to interconnected motions. Starting in the early 1970s the term ''internet'' was used as a shorthand form of the technical term [[internetwork]], the result of interconnecting computer networks with special gateways or routers. It was also used as a verb meaning to connect together, especially for networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=Internet, n |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00304286 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |edition=Draft |date=March 2009 |quote=Shortened &lt; INTERNETWORK n., perhaps influenced by similar words in -net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., gives nineteenth-century use and pre-Internet verb use&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used interchangeably in everyday speech; it is common to speak of &quot;going on the Internet&quot; when invoking a [[web browser]] to view [[web page]]s. However, the Internet is a particular global computer network connecting millions of computing devices; the [[World Wide Web]] is just one of many [[Internet Services|services]] running on the Internet. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents (web pages) and other [[web resource]]s, linked by [[hyperlink]]s and [[uniform resource locator|URL]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.1|title= Links |accessdate=13 August 2008 |work=HTML 4.01 Specification |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium |date=HTML 4.01 Specification | quote = [T]he link (or hyperlink, or Web link) [is] the basic hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the primary forces driving the success of the Web. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Web, a multitude of other services are implemented over the Internet, including [[e-mail]], [[file transfer]], [[remote administration|remote computer control]], [[newsgroup]]s, and [[online game]]s.

The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for [[internetworking]], where multiple separate networks could be joined together into a network of networks.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The first two nodes of what would become the [[ARPANET]] were interconnected between [[Leonard Kleinrock]]'s Network Measurement Center at the [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|UCLA's School of Engineering and Applied Science]] and [[Douglas Engelbart|Douglas Engelbart's]] NLS system at [[SRI International]] (SRI) in [[Menlo Park, California]], on 29 October 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;NetValley&quot;&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/intval.html &quot;Roads and Crossroads of Internet History&quot;] by Gregory Gromov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The third site on the ARPANET was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics center at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]], and the fourth was the [[University of Utah]] Graphics Department.

In 1982, the [[Internet Protocol Suite]] (TCP/IP) was standardized and the concept of a world-wide network of fully interconnected TCP/IP networks called the Internet was introduced.

TCP/IP network access expanded again in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network ([[NSFNET]]) provided access to [[supercomputer]] sites in the United States from research and education organizations, first at 56 kbit/s and later at 1.5 Mbit/s and 45 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merit.edu/about/history/pdf/NSFNET_final.pdf ''NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report 1987-1995''], Karen D.

Since the mid-1990s the Internet has had a tremendous impact on culture and commerce, including the rise of near instant communication by email, [[instant messaging]], [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) &quot;phone calls&quot;, [[Video chat|two-way interactive video calls]], and the [[World Wide Web]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5242252.stm How the web went world wide], Mark Ward, Technology Correspondent, BBC News. Retrieved 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[discussion forums]], blogs, [[social networking]], and [[online shopping]] sites. Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more. The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and [[social networking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3626274 |title=Brazil, Russia, India and China to Lead Internet Growth Through 2011 |publisher=Clickz.com |accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/internet.size.pdf |format=PDF| title=The size and growth rate of the Internet | accessdate=21 May 2007 | author=Coffman, K.

===Protocols===
{{Main|Internet protocol suite}}
[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|right|300px|As the user data is processed down through the protocol stack, each layer adds an encapsulation at the sending host. Data is transmitted &quot;over the wire&quot; at the link level, left to right. The encapsulation stack procedure is reversed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays remove and add a new link encapsulation for retransmission, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]
{{IP stack}}
The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. While the hardware can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the rigorous standardization process of the software architecture that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been delegated to the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting discussions and final standards are published in a series of publications, each called a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC), freely available on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s.  Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.

The Internet standards describe a framework known as the [[Internet protocol suite]]. This is a model architecture that divides methods into a layered system of protocols (RFC 1122, RFC 1123). The layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], the space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications, e.g., a web browser program.  Below this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on ''different hosts'' via the network (e.g., [[client–server model]]) with appropriate data exchange methods. Underlying these layers are the core networking technologies, consisting of two layers. The [[internet layer]] enables computers to identify and locate each other via [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and allows them to connect to one another via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, at the bottom of the architecture, is a software layer, the [[link layer]], that provides connectivity between hosts on the same local network link, such as a local area network ([[LAN]]) or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]]. The model, also known as [[TCP/IP]], is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware, which the model therefore does not concern itself with in any detail.  Other models have been developed, such as the [[Open Systems Interconnection]] (OSI) model, but they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation; many similarities exist and the TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.

The most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems ([[IP address]]es) for computers on the Internet. IP enables internetworking and in essence establishes the Internet itself.  IP Version 4 ([[IPv4]]) is the initial version used on the first generation of today's Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3&amp;nbsp;billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) Internet hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], which entered its final stage in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Huston | first=Geoff | title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated | url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html | accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the global address allocation pool was exhausted.  A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. [[IPv6]] is currently in growing [[IPv6 deployment|deployment]] around the world, since Internet address registries ([[Regional Internet registry|RIRs]]) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/knowledge/about_resources/ceo_letter.pdf |title=Notice of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Address Depletion |format=PDF |accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPv6 is not interoperable with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. This means software upgrades or translator facilities are necessary for networking devices that need to communicate on both networks. Most modern computer operating systems already support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructures, however, are still lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (e.g., [[peering agreement]]s), and by technical specifications or protocols that describe how to exchange data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.

===Routing===
[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution &amp; Core.svg|400px|right|thumb|upright=2.5|Internet packet routing is accomplished among various tiers of Internet Service Providers.]]

[[Internet Service Provider]]s connect customers (thought of at the &quot;bottom&quot; of the routing hierarchy) to customers of other ISPs. At the &quot;top&quot; of the routing hierarchy are ten or so [[Tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies which exchange traffic directly &quot;across&quot; to all other Tier 1 networks via unpaid [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network]]s buy [[Internet transit]] from other ISP to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in unpaid peering (especially for local partners of a similar size). ISPs can use a single &quot;upstream&quot; provider for connectivity, or use [[multihoming]] to provide protection from problems with individual links.  [[Internet exchange point]]s create physical connections between multiple ISPs, often hosted in buildings owned by independent third parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Computers and routers use [[routing table]]s to direct IP packets among locally connected machines. Tables can be constructed manually or automatically via [[DHCP]] for an individual computer or a [[routing protocol]] for routers themselves. In single-homed situations, a [[default route]] usually points &quot;up&quot; toward an ISP providing transit. Higher-level ISPs use the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] to sort out paths to any given [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|range of IP addresses]] across the complex connections of the global Internet.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Academic institutions, large companies, governments, and other organizations can perform the same role as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks of individual computers. Research networks tend to interconnect into large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. These in turn are built around smaller networks.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Not all [[computer networks]] are connected to the Internet. For example, some [[classified United States website]]s are only accessible from separate secure networks.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===General structure===
The Internet structure and its usage characteristics have been studied extensively. It has been determined that both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=A. L. Barab´asi|first=R. Albert|title=Statistical mechanics of complex networks|journal=Rev. Mod.

Many computer scientists describe the Internet as a &quot;prime example of a large-scale, highly engineered, yet highly complex system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Walter|last=Willinger|first2=Ramesh|last2=Govindan|first3=Sugih|last3=Jamin|first4=Vern|last4=Paxson|first5=Scott|last5=Shenker|year=2002|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_1/2573 Scaling phenomena in the Internet|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|issue=99|pages=2573–2580|doi=10.1073/pnas.012583099|title=Scaling phenomena in the Internet: Critically examining criticality|volume=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet is heterogeneous; for instance, [[Bit rate|data transfer rate]]s and physical characteristics of connections vary widely. The Internet exhibits &quot;[[Emergence|emergent phenomena]]&quot; that depend on its large-scale organization. For example, data transfer rates exhibit temporal [[self-similarity]]. The principles of the routing and addressing methods for traffic in the Internet reach back to their origins in the 1960s when the eventual scale and popularity of the network could not be anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Maxymuk, John. &quot;Internet&quot;. The Bottom Line, 1987, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the possibility of developing alternative structures is investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jesdanun |first=Anick |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003667811_btrebuildnet16.html |title=Internet Makeover?

The Internet structure was found to be highly robust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R. Cohen|first=K. Erez, D. ben-Avraham, [[Shlomo Havlin|S.

==Governance==
{{Main|Internet governance}}
[[File:Icannheadquarters.jpg|thumb|ICANN headquarters in [[Marina Del Rey]], California, United States]]

The Internet is a [[global network|globally distributed network]] comprising many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks. It operates without a central governing body. However, to maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN), headquartered in [[Marina del Rey, California]]. ICANN is the authority that coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces, in which names and numbers are uniquely assigned, are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet. ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. 

ICANN's role in coordinating the assignment of unique identifiers distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet. The government of the United States continues to have a primary role in approving changes to the [[DNS root zone]] that lies at the heart of the domain name system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/bush_net_policy/ &quot;Bush administration annexes internet&quot;], Kieren McCarthy, The Register, 1 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored [[World Summit on the Information Society]], held in [[Tunis]], established the [[Internet Governance Forum]] (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the Internet's core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise.

==Modern uses==
The Internet allows greater flexibility in working hours and location, especially with the spread of unmetered high-speed connections. The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.

Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]].

The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills has made [[collaboration|collaborative]] work dramatically easier, with the help of [[collaborative software]]. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]]. Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.

[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.

The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily, wherever they may be. They may do this with or without [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[Virtual Private Network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN|url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013|publisher=Librenix|accessdate=21 July 2010|date=4 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.

==Services==

===World Wide Web===
Many people use the terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'', or just the ''Web'', interchangeably, but the two terms are not [[synonymous]]. The [[World Wide Web]] is a global set of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]] and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers|servers]], and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web, but it is only one of the hundreds of communication protocols used on the Internet. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.

World Wide Web browser software, such as Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engine]]s like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]] and [[Google (search engine)|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.

The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. Publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition, however. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result. One example of this practice is [[Microsoft]], whose [[software developer|product developers]] publish their personal blogs in order to pique the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular, and have become increasingly sophisticated. Whereas operations such as [[Angelfire]] and [[GeoCities]] have existed since the early days of the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as [[social network service]]s rather than simply as web page hosts.

[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]] or the sale of products and services directly via the Web continues to grow.

When the Web began in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], ready to be sent to a user's browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become more automated and more dynamic. Websites are often created using [[content management]] or [[wiki]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of a club or other organization or members of the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose, while casual visitors view and read this content in its final HTML form.  There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.

===Communication===
Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents and other files are sent as [[email attachment]]s. Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.

[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]]. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.

Voice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently, a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no &quot;extra features&quot; may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] also offer VoIP chat features.

===Data transfer===
[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server for easy download by others. It can be put into a &quot;shared location&quot; or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of &quot;[[mirror (computing)|mirror]]&quot; servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed&amp;nbsp;– usually fully encrypted&amp;nbsp;– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.

[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet &quot;broadcasters&quot; who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where&amp;nbsp;– usually audio&amp;nbsp;– material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.

Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40241749/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV&amp;nbsp;– Technology &amp; science&amp;nbsp;– Tech and gadgets&amp;nbsp;– Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=MSNBC |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a [[Adobe Flash|flash]]-based web player to stream and show video files. Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile. YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/t/fact_sheet |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qyMMarNd |archivedate=4 July 2010|title=YouTube Fact Sheet|publisher=YouTube, LLC |accessdate=20 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
{{Main|Internet access}}

Common methods of [[Internet access]] in homes include dial-up, landline [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] (over [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optic]] or copper wires), [[Wi-Fi]], [[Satellite Internet|satellite]] and [[3G]]/[[4G]] technology [[mobile phone|cell phones]]. Public places to use the Internet include libraries and [[Internet cafe]]s, where computers with Internet connections are available. There are also [[Internet kiosk|Internet access points]] in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops, in some cases just for brief use while standing. Various terms are used, such as &quot;public Internet kiosk&quot;, &quot;public access terminal&quot;, and &quot;Web [[payphone]]&quot;. Many hotels now also have public terminals, though these are usually fee-based. These terminals are widely accessed for various usage like ticket booking, bank deposit, online payment etc. Wi-Fi provides wireless access to computer networks, and therefore can do so to the Internet itself. [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Hotspots]] providing such access include [[Wi-Fi#Internet access|Wi-Fi cafes]], where would-be users need to bring their own wireless-enabled devices such as a laptop or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]. These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based. A hotspot need not be limited to a confined location. A whole campus or park, or even an entire city can be enabled.

[[Grassroots]] efforts have led to [[wireless community network]]s. Commercial Wi-Fi services covering large city areas are in place in London, [[Vienna]], [[Toronto]], San Francisco, [[Philadelphia]], Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. The Internet can then be accessed from such places as a park bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasternak |first=Sean B. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000082&amp;sid=aQ0ZfhMa4XGQ&amp;refer=canada |title=Toronto Hydro to Install Wireless Network in Downtown Toronto |publisher=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Wi-Fi, there have been experiments with proprietary mobile wireless networks like [[Ricochet (Internet service)|Ricochet]], various high-speed data services over cellular phone networks, and fixed wireless services. High-end mobile phones such as [[smartphone]]s in general come with Internet access through the phone network. Web browsers such as [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] are available on these advanced handsets, which can also run a wide variety of other Internet software. More mobile phones have Internet access than PCs, though this is not as widely used.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;By 2013, mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common Web access device worldwide&quot;, according a forecast in [http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1278413 &quot;Gartner Highlights Key Predictions for IT Organizations and Users in 2010 and Beyond&quot;], Gartner, Inc., 13 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; An Internet access provider and protocol matrix differentiates the methods used to get online.

An Internet blackout or outage can be caused by local signaling interruptions. Disruptions of [[submarine communications cable]]s may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the [[2008 submarine cable disruption]].  Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.  Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Guardian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access|title=Georgian woman cuts off web access to whole of Armenia|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of [[Internet censorship]], as in the blockage of the [[Internet in Egypt]], whereby approximately 93%&lt;ref name=&quot;renesys1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =Cowie| first =James| title =Egypt Leaves the Internet| publisher =[[Renesys]]| url =http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml | accessdate=28 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w51j0pga |archivedate=28 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|anti-government protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12306041 |work=BBC News | title=Egypt severs internet connection amid growing unrest |date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall Internet usage has seen tremendous growth. From 2000 to 2009, the number of Internet users globally rose from 394 million to 1.858 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/statistics/ Internet users graphs], Market Information and Statistics, International Telecommunications Union&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion [[Google]] searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71940/google-earth-demonstrates-how-technology-benefits-ris-civil-society-govt |title=Google Earth demonstrates how technology benefits RI`s civil society, govt |publisher=Antara News |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent language for communication on the Internet has been English. This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a [[lingua franca]]. Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the [[ASCII|American Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (ASCII), a subset of the [[Latin alphabet]].

After English (27%), the most requested languages on the [[World Wide Web]] are Chinese (23%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats], updated for 30 June 2010.

However, some glitches such as ''[[mojibake]]'' (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain.

In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30. Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email). Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos. Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.&lt;ref&gt;How men and women use the Internet Pew Research Center 28 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking sites, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.rapleaf.com/company_press_2008_07_29.html |title=Rapleaf Study on Social Network Users}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/178175272.html |title=Women Ahead Of Men In Online Tv, Dvr, Games, And Social Media. |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of blogs, men were more likely to blog in the first place; among those who blog, men were more likely to have a professional blog, whereas women were more likely to have a personal blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technorati.com/blogging/state-of-the-blogosphere/ |title=Technorati's State of the Blogosphere |publisher=Technorati |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Euromonitor, by 2020 43.7% of the world's population will be users of the Internet. Splitting by country, in 2011 Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands had the highest internet penetration by the number of users, with more than 90% of the population with access.

==Social impact==
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet}}
The Internet has enabled entirely new forms of social interaction, activities, and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread usability and access. In the first decade of the 21st century, the first generation is raised with widespread availability of Internet connectivity, bringing consequences and concerns in areas such as personal privacy and identity, and distribution of copyrighted materials.  These &quot;[[digital natives]]&quot; face a variety of challenges that were not present for prior generations.

===Social networking and entertainment===
{{see also|Social networking service#Social impact}}
Many people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to find out more about their interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. The Internet has seen a growing number of [[Web desktop]]s, where users can access their files and settings via the Internet.

[[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[MySpace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs.

The Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic. Today, many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of [[Flash animation|Flash movies]] are also popular. Over 6&amp;nbsp;million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The [[internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html &quot;Internet Pornography Statistics&quot;], Jerry Ropelato, Top Ten Reviews, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although many governments have attempted to restrict both industries' use of the Internet, in general this has failed to stop their widespread popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/SmallBiz/story?id=4151592 &quot;Do It Yourself! Amateur Porn Stars Make Bank&quot;], Russell Goldman, ABC News, 22 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of leisure activity on the Internet is [[multiplayer gaming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/trendsdecade.htm &quot;Top Online Game Trends of the Decade&quot;], Dave Spohn, About.com, 15 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from [[MMORPG]] to [[first-person shooter]]s, from [[role-playing video game]]s to [[online gambling]]. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as [[GameSpy Arcade|GameSpy]] and [[MPlayer.com|MPlayer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://internetgames.about.com/od/gamingnews/a/timeline.htm &quot;Internet Game Timeline: 1963&amp;nbsp;– 2004&quot;], Dave Spohn, About.com, 2 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games. Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.

Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carole Hughes, Boston College |url=https://www2.bc.edu/~hughesc/abstract.html |title=The Relationship Between Internet Use and Loneliness Among College Students |publisher=Boston College |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the &quot;[[I am lonely will anyone speak to me]]&quot; thread.

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: &quot;highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, &quot;The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. “ In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyberslacking]] can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/net-abuse-hits-small-city-firms-1-892163 |title=Net abuse hits small city firms |work=The Scotsman  |date= 11 September 2003|accessdate=7 August 2009 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet addiction disorder]] is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life. Psychologist Nicolas Carr believe that Internet use has other [[How internet use affects humans|effects on individuals]], for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshallowsbook.com/nicholascarr/Nicholas_Carrs_The_Shallows.html ''The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains''], Nicholas Carr, W. W. Norton, 7 June 2010, 276 pp., ISBN 0-393-07222-3, ISBN 978-0-393-07222-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic business===
{{Main|Electronic business}}
Electronic business (E-business) involves business processes spanning the entire [[value chain]]: electronic purchasing and [[supply chain management]], processing orders electronically, handling customer service, and cooperating with business partners. [[E-commerce]] seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners. 

According to research firm [[International Data Corporation|IDC]], the size of total worldwide e-commerce, when 
global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are added together, 
will equate to $16 trillion in 2013. [[IDate]], another research firm, estimates  the global market for digital products and services  at $4.4 trillion in 2013. A report by [[Oxford Economics]] adds those two together to estimate the total size of the [[digital economy]] at $20.4 trillion, equivalent to roughly 13.8% of global sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf &quot;The New Digital Economy: How it will transform business&quot;], Oxford Economics, 2 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World  | work=The Atlantic  | author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13 | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ &quot;E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland&quot;] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge &quot;‘Free Shipping Day’ Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago&quot;] ''Comscore'', December 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ &quot;The Death of the American Shopping Mall&quot;] ''The Atlantic — Cities'', December 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telecommuting===
{{Main|Telecommuting}}
Remote work is facilitated by tools such as [[groupware]], [[virtual private networks]], [[conference calling]], [[videoconferencing]], and [[Voice over IP]] (VOIP). It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As [[broadband]] Internet connections become more commonplace, more and more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate [[intranet]] and internal phone networks.

===Crowdsourcing===
{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}
Internet provides a particularly good venue for crowdsourcing ([[outsourcing]] tasks to a distributed group of people) since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized and thus can feel more comfortable sharing.

Crowdsourcing systems are used to accomplish a variety of tasks. For example, the crowd may be invited to develop a new technology, carry out a design task, refine or carry out the steps of an algorithm (see [[human-based computation]]), or help capture, systematize, or analyze large amounts of data (see also [[citizen science]]).

[[Wiki]]s have also been used in the academic community for sharing and dissemination of information across institutional and international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142215.1142259|title=New Interfaces For Musical Expression|isbn=2-84426-314-3|author=MM Wanderley, D Birnbaum, J Malloch|year=2006|publisher=IRCAM&amp;nbsp;– Centre Pompidou|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on [[grant writing]], [[strategic planning]], departmental documentation, and committee work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Putting Wikis to Work in Libraries|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a901841555&amp;db=all|author=Nancy T.

===Politics and political revolutions===
The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of [[Howard Dean]] in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet. Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing in order to carry out their mission, having given rise to [[Internet activism]], most notably practiced by rebels in the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name = cascading&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/the-cascading-effects-of-the-arab-spring-28575/|title=The Arab Uprising's Cascading Effects|publisher=Miller-mccune.com|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2011/chokoshvili_davit.pdf The Role of the Internet in Democratic Transition: Case Study of the Arab Spring], Davit Chokoshvili, Master's Thesis, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that [[social media]] websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, helped people organize the political revolutions in Egypt where it helped certain classes of protesters organize protests, communicate grievances, and disseminate information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10youth.html | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Wired and Shrewd, Young Egyptians Guide Revolt | date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential of the Internet as a civic tool of communicative power was thoroughly explored by [[Simon R. B. Berdal]] in his thesis of 2004: {{quote|''As the globally evolving Internet provides ever new access points to virtual discourse forums, it also promotes new civic relations and associations within which communicative power may flow and accumulate. Thus, traditionally ... national-embedded peripheries get entangled into greater, international peripheries, with stronger combined powers... The Internet, as a consequence, changes the topology of the &quot;centre-periphery&quot; model, by stimulating conventional peripheries to interlink into &quot;super-periphery&quot; structures, which enclose and &quot;besiege&quot; several centres at once.''&lt;ref name=simonBerdal2004&gt;{{Cite document

Berdal, therefore, extends the [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] notion of the [[Public sphere]] to the Internet, and underlines the inherent global and civic nature that intervowen Internet technologies provide. To limit the growing civic potential of the Internet, Berdal also notes how &quot;self-protective measures&quot; are put in place by those threatened by it: {{quote|If we consider China’s attempts to filter &quot;unsuitable material&quot; from the Internet, most of us would agree that this resembles a self-protective measure by the system against the growing civic potentials of the Internet. Nevertheless, both types represent limitations to &quot;peripheral capacities&quot;. Thus, the Chinese government tries to prevent communicative power to build up and unleash (as the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen Square uprising]] suggests, the government may find it wise to install &quot;upstream measures&quot;). Even though limited, the Internet is proving to be an empowering tool also to the Chinese periphery: Analysts believe that Internet petitions have influenced policy implementation in favour of the public’s online-articulated will ...&lt;ref name=simonBerdal2004 /&gt;}}

===Philanthropy===
The spread of low-cost internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer]] charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals.  Websites, such as [[DonorsChoose]] and [[GlobalGiving]], allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice.

A popular twist on internet-based philanthropy is the use of [[peer-to-peer lending]] for charitable purposes. [[Kiva]] pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''], by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 &amp; 16 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom|first=Stephanie|title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes|work=The New York Times|page=6|date=9 November 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the recent spread of low cost Internet access in [[developing countries]] has made genuine international person-to-person  philanthropy increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit [[Zidisha]] tapped into this trend to offer the first person-to-person microfinance platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without intermediaries. Members can fund loans for as little as a dollar, which the borrowers then use to develop business activities that improve their families' incomes while repaying loans to the members with interest. Borrowers access the internet via public cybercafes, donated laptops in village schools, and even smart phones, then create their own profile pages through which they share photos and information about themselves and their businesses. As they repay their loans, borrowers continue to share updates and dialogue with lenders via their profile pages. This direct web-based connection allows members themselves to take on many of the communication and recording tasks traditionally performed by local organizations, bypassing geographic barriers and dramatically reducing the cost of microfinance services to the entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ &quot;Zidisha Set to &quot;Expand&quot; in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance&quot;, Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some governments, such as those of [[Burma]], [[Iran]], [[Censorship in North Korea|North Korea]], the [[Censorship in China|Mainland China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]] restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet, especially political and religious content. This is accomplished through software that filters domains and content so that they may not be easily accessed or obtained without elaborate circumvention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12187 ''Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace''], Ronald J.

In Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, major Internet service providers have voluntarily, possibly to avoid such an arrangement being turned into law, agreed to restrict access to sites listed by authorities. While this list of forbidden URLs is supposed to contain addresses of only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Register&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Finland censors anti-censorship site | work=[[The Register]] | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/18/finnish_policy_censor_activist/ | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as [[child pornography]], via the Internet, but do not mandate filtering software. There are many free and commercially available software programs, called [[content-control software]], with which a user can choose to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit a child's access to pornographic materials or depiction of violence.

'''Biology''' is a [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and [[organism|living organisms]], including their structure, function, growth, [[evolution]], distribution, and [[taxonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.]&lt;/ref&gt; Biology has many [[List_of_biology_disciplines#Branches_of_biology|subdisciplines]] unified by five so-called [[axiom]]s of modern biology:&lt;ref name=&quot;avila_biology&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Avila, Vernon L. |title=Biology: Investigating life on earth |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Boston |year=1995 |pages=11–18|isbn=0-86720-942-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[cell theory|Cells]] are the basic unit of life
# [[Gene]]s are the basic unit of [[heredity]]
# New species and inherited traits are the product of [[evolution]]
# An organism [[homeostasis|regulates]] its internal environment to maintain a stable and constant condition
# Living organisms consume and transform [[energy]]

Subdisciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied and the methods used to study them: [[biochemistry]] examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; [[molecular biology]] studies the complex interactions among biological [[molecule]]s; [[cellular biology]] examines the basic building block of all life, the [[cell (biology)|cell]]; [[physiology]] examines the physical and chemical functions of [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[organ system]]s of an organism; [[evolutionary biology]] examines the [[evolution|processes]] that produced the diversity of life; and [[ecology]] examines how organisms interact in their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.weber.edu/sciencemuseum/pages/life_main.asp Life Science, Weber State Museum of Natural Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of biology}}
[[File:Tree of life by Haeckel.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Haeckel]]'s Tree of Life (1879)]]
The term ''[[wikt:biology|biology]]'' is derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βίος|βίος]]}}, ''bios'', &quot;[[life]]&quot; and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''-logia'', &quot;study of.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |author= |date= |work=Info.com |publisher= |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin form of the term first appeared in 1736 when [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) used ''biologi'' in his ''Bibliotheca botanica''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by Michael Christoph Hanov, a disciple of Christian Wolff. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was used in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg Roose used the term in a book, ''Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft'', in the preface. Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802–22) by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus, who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J.|title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-71210-9|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre]. (1:4)

Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. [[Natural philosophy]] was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[China]]. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal study of [[medicine]] dates back to [[Hippocrates]] (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was [[Aristotle]] (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his [[History of Animals]] and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].

Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dinawari]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name=Fahd-815&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahd|first=Toufic|contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|ref=harv}}, in {{Cite book |last1=Morelon |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-12410-7 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Antony van Leeuwenhoek]]'s improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].&lt;ref&gt;Magner, ''A History of the Life Sciences'', pp 133–144&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, ''Genesis'', chapter 7; Coleman, ''Biology in the Nineteenth Century'', chapters 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gould 2002 187&quot;&gt;[[#Gould2002|Gould (2002)]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: &quot;Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent&quot;; and chapter 11: &quot;The causation of evolution: natural selection&quot;; Larson, ''Evolution'', chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was the subject of [[Creation–evolution controversy|controversy]] (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and [[population genetics]]. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2940601.stm | title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Science/Nature &amp;#124; Human genome finally complete | accessdate=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

==Foundations of modern biology==
Much of modern biology can be encompassed within five unifying principles: cell theory, evolution, genetics, homeostasis, and energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;avila_biology&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Epithelial-cells.jpg|thumb|left|Cells in culture, [[staining (biology)|stained]] for [[keratin]] (red) and [[DNA]] (green)]]

===Cell theory===
{{Main|Cell theory}}
[[Cell theory]] states that the [[cell biology|cell]] is the fundamental unit of [[life]], and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the [[secretion|secreted]] products of those cells (e.g. [[animal shell|shells]]). All cells arise from other cells through [[cell division]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mazzarello, P|title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory|journal=Nature Cell Biology|volume=1|pages=E13–E15|year=1999|doi=10.1038/8964|pmid=10559875|issue=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the phenomenon of [[energy transfer|energy flow]] occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as [[metabolism]]. Finally, cells contain hereditary information ([[DNA]]) which is passed from cell to cell during cell division.

===Evolution===
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]
{{Main|Evolution}}
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through [[evolution]], and that all life-forms known have a [[Common descent|common origin]]. Introduced into the scientific lexicon by [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] in 1809,&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Packard |first=Alpheus Spring |title= Lamarck, the founder of Evolution: his life and work with translations of his writings on organic evolution|year= 1901 |publisher= Longmans, Green. |location=New York |isbn=0-405-12562-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; evolution was established by [[Charles Darwin]] fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force: [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html The Complete Works of Darwin Online – Biography.] ''darwin-online.org.uk''. Retrieved on 2006-12-15&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Dobzhansky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri–St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: &quot;''The Origin of Species'' has special claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world&amp;nbsp;... It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling.&quot; {{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection |last= |first= |authorlink= |editor=Carroll, Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario|isbn= 1-55111-337-6|page=15 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Alfred Russel Wallace]] is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.

Darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of [[natural selection]] and [[artificial selection]] or [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species, 1st, John Murray&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic drift]] was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the [[modern synthesis]] of the theory.&lt;ref name = GGS&gt;{{Cite book | last = Simpson | first = George Gaylord | author-link = George Gaylord Simpson | year = 1967 | title = The Meaning of Evolution | publisher = Yale University Press | edition = Second | isbn = 0-300-00952-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of the [[species]]—which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its [[phylogeny]]. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of [[DNA sequence]]s conducted within [[molecular biology]] or [[genomics]], and comparisons of [[fossil]]s or other records of ancient organisms in [[paleontology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ Phylogeny on bio-medicine.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including [[phylogenetics]], [[phenetics]], and [[cladistics]]. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see [[evolutionary timeline]].)
{{clear right}}

The theory of evolution postulates that all [[organism]]s on the [[Earth]], both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral [[gene pool]]. This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | author = De Duve, Christian | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2002| page = 44 | isbn = 0-19-515605-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s (see: [[origin of life]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Futuyma&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Futuyma, DJ|title=Evolution|year=2005|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=978-0-87893-187-3|oclc=57311264 57638368 62621622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
{{Main|Genetics}}
[[Gene]]s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A [[gene]] is a unit of [[heredity]] and corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into [[protein]]s. Cells [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a DNA gene into an [[RNA]] version of the gene, and a [[ribosome]] then [[Translation (biology)|translates]] the RNA into a protein, a sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The [[genetic code|translation code]] from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms, but slightly different for some. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for [[insulin]] in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_33/b4046083.htm From SemBiosys, A New Kind Of Insulin] INSIDE WALL STREET By Gene G. Marcial(AUGUST 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA usually occurs as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as its [[genome]]. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], along with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thanbichler M, Wang S, Shapiro L |title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=J Cell Biochem |volume=96 |issue=3 | pages=506–21 |year=2005 |pmid=15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 Genotype definition – Medical Dictionary definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeostasis===
{{Main|Homeostasis}}
[[Image:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|250pc| The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], which directs the [[pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH]]. In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[cortisol]]. The GCs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of GCs has been released.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, PH; Johnson, GB. ''Biology'', Fifth Edition, Boston: Hill Companies, Inc. 1999. page 1058.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Homeostasis]] is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple [[dynamic equilibrium]] adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living [[organism]]s, whether [[Single celled|unicellular]] or [[multicellular]], exhibit homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Rodolfo, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis Explanation of Homeostasis on scientificamerican.com]. Retrieved Oct. 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through [[negative feedback]]. This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of [[glucagon]] when sugar levels are too low.

[[File:Energy and life.png|thumb|240px|left|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]

===Energy===
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of [[energy]]. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract [[Chemistry#Energy|energy]] from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, [[molecule]]s of [[chemical substance]]s that constitute [[food]] play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological [[chemical reaction]]s; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules.

The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or [[autotroph]]s. Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal | author = D.A. Bryant &amp; N.-U.

Some of the captured energy is used to produce [[biomass]] to sustain [[life]] and provide energy for growth and development. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are [[metabolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Campbell, Neil A. and Reece Jane B|title=Biology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |year=2001 |chapter=6|isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2 |accessyear= 2008 |oclc=47521441 48195194 53439122 55707478 64759228 79136407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colvard, 2009&quot;&gt;Bartsch/Colvard, ''The Living Environment''.

===Structural===
{{Main|Molecular biology|Cell biology|Genetics|Developmental biology}}
[[Image:biological cell.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic of typical animal [[cell (biology)|cell]] depicting the various [[organelle]]s and structures.]]

[[Molecular biology]] is the study of biology at a molecular level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Molecular_biology Molecular Biology – Definition from biology-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]]. Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated.

[[Cell biology]] studies the structural and [[physiology|physiological]] properties of [[cell (biology)|cells]], including their [[behavior]]s, interactions, and [[natural environment|environment]]. This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for single-celled organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.

[[Anatomy]] considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as [[organ (biology)|organs]] and organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/107/1.html &quot;Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;.] 20th edition. 1918. Henry Gray.

&lt;/ref&gt; Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins, which in turn play a large role in influencing (though, in many instances, not completely determining) the final [[phenotype]] of the organism. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of [[genetic interaction]]s. Within organisms, genetic information generally is carried in [[chromosome]]s, where it is represented in the [[DNA sequence|chemical structure]] of particular [[DNA]] [[molecule]]s.

[[Developmental biology]] studies the process by which organisms grow and develop. Originating in [[embryology]], modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of [[cell growth]], [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and &quot;[[morphogenesis]],&quot; which is the process that progressively gives rise to [[biological tissue|tissues]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[anatomy]].

===Physiological===
{{Main|Physiology}}

Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of &quot;structure to function&quot; is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.

Physiology studies how for example [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with [[medicine|medically]] oriented disciplines such as [[neurology]] and [[immunology]].

===Evolutionary===
[[Current research in evolutionary biology|Evolutionary research]] is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], or [[herpetology]], but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jablonski D |title=The future of the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=284 |issue=5423 |pages=2114–16 |year=1999 |pmid=10381868 |doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John H. Gillespie]] Population Genetics: A Concise Guide, Johns Hopkins Press, 1998. ISBN 0-8018-5755-4.&lt;/ref&gt; and evolutionary theory. In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the [[modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Vassiliki Betta Smocovitis Unifiying Biology: the evolutionary synthesis and evolutionary biology ISBN 0-691-03343-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are [[phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]].

===Systematics===

The classification, [[taxonomy]], and nomenclature of biological organisms is administered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], and [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] for animals, plants, and bacteria, respectively.

U.S. National Institutes of Health website. Retrieved on 2009-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, several other viral classification systems do exist.

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: [[Monera]]; [[Protist]]a; [[Fungus|Fungi]]; [[Plant]]ae; [[Animal]]ia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Margulis|first=L|coauthors=Schwartz, KV|authorlink=Lynn Margulis|title=Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth|edition=3rd|publisher= WH Freeman &amp; Co|location=|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7167-3183-2|series=|oclc=223623098 237138975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacterium|Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria); [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;domain&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Woese C, Kandler O, Wheelis M | title = Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/87/12/4576 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 87 | issue = 12 | pages = 4576–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2112744 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | pmc = 54159 | ref = harv | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.&lt;ref name=&quot;domain&quot;/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]].

There is also a series of intracellular [[parasite]]s that are &quot;on the edge of life&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rybicki EP | year = 1990 | title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics | url = | journal = S Aft J Sci | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 182–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions that define life. They are classified as [[virus (biology)|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, or [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]].

The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://books.google.com/?id=hVUU7Gq8QskC&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=species%20epithet%20capitalize&amp;pg=PA198#v=onepage&amp;q=species%20epithet%20capitalize | page = 198 | title = Writing for Science and Engineering: Papers, Presentation | author = Heather Silyn-Roberts | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-7506-4636-5 | publisher = Butterworth-Heinemann | location = Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0065Ch7OaGoNSec1a60.htm#recF | title = Recommendation 60F | work = [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], Vienna Code | year = 2006 | pages = 60F.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] (ICBN), the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), and the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB).

A merging draft, [[BioCode]], was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | author=John McNeill | date=1996-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bionomenclature.net/index.html|title=The Draft BioCode (2011)|publisher=International Committee on Bionomenclature (ICB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2011/00000060/00000001/art00019] Greuter, W.; Garrity, G.; Hawksworth, D.L.; Jahn, R.; Kirk, P.M.; Knapp, S.; McNeill, J.; Michel, E.; Patterson, D.J.; Pyle, R.; Tindall, B.J.

The [[Virus classification|International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature]] (ICVCN) remains outside the BioCode.

[[Ecology]] studies the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]], and the interactions between organisms and their [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Begon |first=M. |coauthors= Townsend, C. R., Harper, J. L. |title=Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems. (4th ed.) |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-1117-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[habitat]] of an organism can be described as the local [[abiotic factors]] such as [[climate]] and [[ecology]], in addition to the other organisms and [[biotic factors]] that share its environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;habitats_of_the_world&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = Habitats of the world | year = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=U-_mlcy8rGgC&amp;pg=PA238 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7614-7523-1 | page = 238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic [[bacterium]] in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African [[savanna]]. For any species, [[behavior]]s can be [[co-operation|co-operative]], [[aggression|aggressive]], [[parasite|parasitic]], or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an [[ecosystem]].

Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from individuals and [[population]]s to [[ecosystem]]s and the [[biosphere]]. The term [[population biology]] is often used interchangeably with [[population ecology]], although ''population biology'' is more frequently used when studying [[diseases]], [[viruses]], and [[microbes]], while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.

[[Ethology]] studies animal [[behavior]] (particularly that of social animals such as [[primate]]s and [[canidae|canids]]), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many ethologists to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;black&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1279921 | pmid = 12042386 | year = 2002 | month = Jun | author = Black, J | title = Darwin in the world of emotions | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 311–3 | issn = 0141-0768 | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | url = http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12042386 | format = Free full text | doi = 10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on topics like [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]].

However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;The earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of natural philosophy along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 17th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Physics intersects with many [[interdisciplinary]] areas of research, such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], and the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.

Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new [[technology|technologies]] that arise from theoretical breakthroughs. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]] or [[nuclear physics]] led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as [[television]], [[computer]]s, [[domestic appliance]]s, and [[nuclear weapon]]s; advances in [[thermodynamics]] led to the development of [[industrialization]]; and advances in [[mechanics]] inspired the development of [[calculus]].

'''[[Modern physics]]''' started with the works of [[Max Planck]] in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[Einstein]] in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], and continued in [[quantum mechanics]] pioneered by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]].

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
In many ways, physics stems from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From [[Thales]]' first attempt to characterize matter, to [[Democritus]]' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as [[natural philosophy]] until the late 18th century.

By the 19th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] to give an adequate description of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenberg |first=Alex |title=Philosophy of Science |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-34317-8}} See Chapter 1 for a discussion on the necessity of philosophy of science.&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method employs ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori reasoning]]'' as well as ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 14 &quot;Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence&quot; ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003), Chapter 15 &quot;Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?&quot; ''Theory and Reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science'' ISBN 0-226-30063-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work, for instance [[Laplace]], who championed [[causal determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Laplace, Pierre Simon, ''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities'', translated from the 6th French edition by Frederick Wilson Truscott and Frederick Lincoln Emory, Dover Publications (New York, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who wrote on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics&quot; Ox Bow Press (1995) ISBN 1-881987-09-4. and &quot;My View of the World&quot; Ox Bow Press (1983) ISBN 0-918024-30-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]] has been called a [[Platonism|Platonist]] by [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose (1996), ''The Nature of Space and Time'' ISBN 0-691-05084-8 p.4 &quot;I think that Roger is a Platonist at heart but he must answer for himself.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a view Penrose discusses in his book, ''[[The Road to Reality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Penrose, ''The Road to Reality'' ISBN 0-679-45443-8&lt;/ref&gt; Hawking refers to himself as an &quot;unashamed reductionist&quot; and takes issue with Penrose's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |coauthors=Abner Shimony, Nancy Cartwright, Stephen Hawking |title=The Large, the Small and the Human Mind |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-78572-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further2|[[Branches of physics]], [[Outline of physics]]}}
Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[Classical physics|classical]] mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research, and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727).

These central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them. These include [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[special relativity]].

===Classical physics===
{{Main|Classical physics}}
[[Classical physics]] includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—[[classical mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[optics]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[electromagnetism]]. [[Classical mechanics]] is concerned with bodies acted on by [[force]]s and bodies in [[motion (physics)|motion]] and may be divided into [[statics]] (study of the forces on a body or bodies at rest), [[kinematics]] (study of motion without regard to its causes), and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into [[solid mechanics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] (known together as [[continuum mechanics]]), the latter including such branches as [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], and [[pneumatics]]. Acoustics, the study of [[sound]], is often considered a branch of mechanics because sound is due to the motions of the particles of air or other medium through which [[sound wave]]s can travel and thus can be explained in terms of the laws of mechanics. Among the important modern branches of acoustics is [[ultrasonics]], the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing. [[Optics]], the study of [[light]], is concerned not only with [[visible light]] but also with [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]], which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. [[Heat]] is a form of [[energy]], the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. [[Electricity]] and [[magnetism]] have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an [[electric current]] gives rise to a [[magnetic field]] and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. [[Electrostatics]] deals with [[electric charge]]s at rest, [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] with moving charges, and [[magnetostatics]] with magnetic poles at rest.

===Modern physics===
{{Main|Modern physics}}
{{Modern Physics}}
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|left|[[Solvay Conference]] of 1927, with prominent physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Planck]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]].]]
Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on the very large or very small scale. For example, [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[nuclear physics]] studies matter on the smallest scale at which [[chemical element]]s can be identified. The [[Particle physics|physics of elementary particles]] is on an even smaller scale, as it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in large [[particle accelerator]]s. On this scale, ordinary, commonsense notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.

The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum theory]] is concerned with the discrete, rather than continuous, nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level, and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The [[theory of relativity]] is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a [[frame of reference]] that is in motion with respect to an observer; the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]] is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] with accelerated motion and its connection with [[gravitation]]. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.

===Difference between classical and modern physics===
[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|350px|left|The basic domains of physics]]
While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability. Loosely speaking, the laws of [[classical physics]] accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match their predictions. [[Albert Einstein]] contributed the framework of [[special relativity]], which replaced notions of [[absolute time and space]] with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Max Planck]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others introduced [[quantum mechanics]], a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified [[quantum mechanics]] and [[special relativity]]. [[General relativity]] allowed for a dynamical, curved [[spacetime]], with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of [[quantum gravity]] are being developed.

[[File:Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|left|Mathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and cosmology.]]

===Prerequisites===
Mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature, especially the laws of physics. This was noted and advocated by [[Pythagoras]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getcited.org/pub/102471397 |title=Dijksterhuis (1986) The mechanization of the world picture: Pythagoras to Newton |publisher=Getcited.org |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The story of mathematics |url=http://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_plato.html |quote=Although usually remembered today as a philosopher, Plato was also one of ancient Greece's most important patrons of mathematics. Inspired by Pythagoras, he founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, where he stressed mathematics as a way of understanding more about reality. In particular, he was convinced that geometry was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. The sign above the Academy entrance read: &quot;Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.&quot; – [[Galileo]] (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]'', as quoted by G. Toraldo Di Francia (1976), ''The Investigation of the Physical World'' ISBN 0-521-29925-X p.10&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].

Physics theories use mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html |title=Applications of Mathematics to the Sciences |publisher=Math.niu.edu |date=25 January 2000 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain order and provide precise formulas, [[analytic solution|precise]] or [[simulation#Computer simulation|estimated]] solutions, quantitative results and predictions. Experiment results in physics are numerical measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like [[scientific computing|computation]] have made [[computational physics]] an active area of research.

[[File:Mathematical Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|The distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.]]
[[Ontology]] is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while math statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.

The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.&lt;ref&gt;The application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories.&quot; Definition from the ''Journal of Mathematical Physics''. http://jmp.aip.org/jmp/staff.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The problems in this field start with a &quot;[[Boundary condition|math model of a physical situation]]&quot; and a &quot;math description of a physical law&quot;. Every math statement used for solution has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.

Physics is a branch of [[fundamental science]], not [[practical science]].&lt;ref&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science, Science. 1917. Page 645&lt;/ref&gt; Physics is also called &quot;the fundamental science&quot; because the subject of study of all branches of [[natural science]] like chemistry, astronomy, geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feynman lectures&quot;/&gt; For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of matter (chemistry's focus on the atomic scale [[Difference between chemistry and physics|distinguishes it from physics]]). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like conservation of energy, mass and charge.

Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.&lt;!--Please add a phrase about how physics first caused industrial revolution, with reliable source--&gt;

===Application and influence===
[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|150px|[[Archimedes' screw]], a [[simple machine]] for lifting]]
[[File:IMG 1729 Gemaal met schroef van Archimedes bij Kinderdijk.JPG|thumb|150px|The application of physical laws in lifting liquids]]
{{Main|Applied physics}}
[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular [[Utility|use]]. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.

The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better particle detectors for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in [[engineering]]. For example, [[statics]], a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other structures. The understanding and use of [[acoustics]] results in better concert halls; similarly, the use of [[optics]] creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, video games, and movies, and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.

With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin of the Earth's core and first atmosphere|study of the origin of the earth]], one can reasonably model earth's [[mass]], [[temperature]], and rate of [[rotation]], over [[time]]. It also allows for simulations in engineering which drastically speed up the development of a new technology.

But there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]] in the physicist's methods and so many other important fields are influenced by physics, e.g. the fields of [[econophysics]] and sociophysics.

==Research==
===Scientific method===
Physicists use [[scientific method|the scientific method]] to test the validity of a [[physical theory]], using a methodical approach to compare the implications of the theory in question with the associated conclusions drawn from [[experiment]]s and observations conducted to test it. Experiments and observations are collected and compared with the predictions and hypotheses made by a theory, thus aiding in the determination or the validity/invalidity of the theory.

A [[scientific law]] is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of a theory, like Newton's law of universal gravitation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=edited by Ted|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|edition=1. publ.|pages=474–476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory and experiment===
{{Main|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}
[[File:Astronaut-EVA.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free-fall]]]]
[[File:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lightning]] is an [[electric current]]]]
Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new experiments.

Physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called [[Phenomenology (science)|phenomenologists]]. Phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory.

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; [[electromagnetism]] was unified this way.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Oersted]].&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,&lt;ref&gt;Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of [[World War II]], the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories. They then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

[[Experiment]]al physics informs, and is informed by, [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Experimental physicists involved in [[basic research]] design and perform experiments with equipment such as [[particle accelerator]]s and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry, developing technologies such as [[MRI|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] and [[transistor]]s. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well-explored by theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Feynman |title=The Character of Physical Law |year=1965 |isbn=0-262-56003-8}} p.157: &quot;In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. They ... very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope and aims===
[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|thumb|left|Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of [[calculus]] to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as [[mechanics]].]]
Physics covers a wide range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]], from [[elementary particle]]s (such as quarks, neutrinos and electrons) to the largest [[superclusters]] of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore physics is sometimes called the &quot;[[fundamental science]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feynman lectures&quot;&gt;''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' Volume I. Feynman, Leighton and Sands. ISBN 0-201-02115-3 See Chapter 3: &quot;The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences&quot; for a general discussion. For the philosophical issue of whether other sciences can be &quot;reduced&quot; to physics, see [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to [[root cause]]s, and then connect these causes together.

For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]]) were attracted to one another by some invisible force. This effect was later called [[magnetism]], and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. A little earlier than the Chinese, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two. This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century, and came to be called [[electricity]]. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—[[electromagnetism]]. This process of &quot;unifying&quot; forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the [[weak nuclear force]] are now considered to be two aspects of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason ([[Theory of Everything]]) for why nature is as it is (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' below for more information).

===Research fields===
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[particle physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; [[geophysics]] and [[biophysics]]. Some physics departments also support research in [[Physics education]].

Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly [[specialization of knowledge|specialized]], and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. &quot;Universalists&quot; such as [[Albert Einstein]] (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atomic, molecular, and optical physics====
{{Main|Atomic, molecular, and optical physics}}
[[Atom]]ic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and [[Optics|optical]] physics (AMO) is the study of [[matter]]–matter and [[light]]–matter interactions on the scale of single [[atom]]s and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of the [[energy]] scales that are relevant. All three areas include both [[classical physics|classical]], semi-classical and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

[[Atomic physics]] studies the [[electron]] shells of [[atom]]s. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,{{citation needed|date=December 2011|reason=Is this within the field of AMO?}} low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see, e.g., [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of [[high-energy physics]].

[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. [[Optical physics]] is distinct from [[optics]] in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects, but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

[[Nuclear Physics]] is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of [[atomic nuclei]].  The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapons]] technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]].

====Astrophysics====
{{Main|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra Deep Field]]]]
[[Astrophysics]] and [[astronomy]] are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the [[solar system]], and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.

The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]].

[[Physical cosmology]] is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe was expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady state theory|steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].

The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]].

Numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/questions_answers.html |title=NASA - Q&amp;A on the GLAST Mission |accessdate=29 April 2009 |work=Nasa: Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/index.html Nasa - Fermi Science] and [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/unidentified_sources.html NASA - Scientists Predict Major Discoveries for GLAST].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/dark_matter.html |title=Dark Matter |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=28 August 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of [[weakly interacting massive particle]]s, complementing similar experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and other underground detectors.

[[IBEX]] is already yielding new [[astrophysical]] discoveries: &quot;No one knows what is creating the [[energetic neutral atom|ENA (energetic neutral atoms)]] ribbon&quot; along the [[termination shock]] of the [[solar wind]], &quot;but everyone agrees that it means the textbook picture of the [[heliosphere]] — in which the solar system's enveloping pocket filled with the solar wind's charged particles is plowing through the onrushing 'galactic wind' of the interstellar medium in the shape of a comet — is wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard A.

==Current research==
{{Further2|[[List of unsolved problems in physics]]}}
[[File:Feynman'sDiagram.JPG|thumb|right|[[Feynman diagram]] signed by [[R.P. Feynman]]]]
[[File:Meissner effect p1390048.jpg|thumb|right|A typical event described by physics: a [[magnet]] levitating above a [[superconductor]] demonstrates the [[Meissner effect]].]]
Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the [[Standard Model]] have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. [[Particle accelerator]]s have begun probing energy scales in the [[TeV]] range, in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the [[Higgs boson]] and [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]].&lt;ref&gt;584 co-authors &quot;Direct observation of the strange 'b' baryon &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;&quot; Fermilab-Pub-07/196-E, 12 June 2007 http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1690v2 finds a mass of 5.774 GeV for the &lt;math&gt;\Xi_{b}^{-}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical attempts to unify [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] into a single theory of [[quantum gravity]], a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomical]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the existence of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating universe|acceleration of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex systems|complexity]], [[Chaos theory|chaos]], or [[turbulence]] are still poorly understood.{{citation needed|time=2010-11-03|date=November 2010}} Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling [[water]], the shape of water [[droplet]]s, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.{{citation needed|time=2010-11-03|date=November 2010}}

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern [[mathematical]] methods and [[computers]], which enabled [[complex systems]] to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of [[turbulence]] in [[aerodynamics]] and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in [[biological]] systems. In 1932, [[Horace Lamb]] said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Goldstein |first=Sydney
|title=Fluid Mechanics in the First Half of this Century
|journal=Annual Reviews in Fluid Mechanics
|year=1969 |volume=1 |pages=1–28

|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:JMR-Memphis1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Lady Justice]] is the symbol of [[justice]]. Lady Justice is depicted as a [[goddess]] equipped with three symbols of justice: a sword symbolising the court's coercive power; scales representing an objective standard by which competing claims are weighed; and a blindfold indicating that justice is or should be meted out objectively, without fear or favor, regardless of power, money, wealth, or identity.&lt;ref&gt;Luban, ''Law's Blindfold'', 23&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Law''' is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. Introduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; but one definition is that law is a [[system]] of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED  ,wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws are made by [[governments]], specifically by their [[legislatures]]. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]] (written or unwritten) and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[society]] in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between [[people]].

A general distinction can be made between [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s (including [[Canon law|Canon]] and [[Socialist law]]), in which the legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[binding precedent|binding]] [[precedent]]s are accepted. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, which is still the case in some countries, particularly Islamic.

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a [[legal remedy]] (often monetary [[damages]]) to the winning [[litigant]].

Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: [[Contract law]] regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on [[derivative (finance)|derivatives markets]]. [[Property law]] regulates the transfer and title of [[personal property]] and [[real property]]. [[Trust law]] applies to assets held for investment and financial security. [[Tort law]] allows claims for compensation if a person's property is [[Harm principle|harmed]]. [[Constitutional law]] provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives. [[Administrative law]] is used to review the decisions of government agencies. [[International law]] governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging from trade to military action.

To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public by public servants, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent [[legal profession]] and a vibrant [[civil society]] inform and support their progress{{Citation needed|reason=This whole paragraph sounds like Original Thought.|date=May 2012}}.

Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[jurisprudence|philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[fairness (disambiguation)|fairness]], and [[justice]]. &quot;In its majestic equality&quot;, said the author [[Anatole France]] in 1894, &quot;the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The original French is: &quot;La loi, dans un grand souci d'égalité, interdit aux riches comme aux pauvres de coucher sous les ponts, de mendier dans les rues et de voler du pain&quot; (France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 350 BC, the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] declared, &quot;The [[rule of law]] is better than the [[absolute monarchy|rule of any individual]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Politics'', Book 3#3:16. n.b. This translation reads, &quot;it is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin]] said: &quot;All law has for its object to confirm and exalt into a system the exploitation of the workers by a ruling class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart and Burgess. Collins Dictionary of Law. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. ISBN 0 00 470009 0. Page 229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] said &quot;more law, less justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [[De officiis]], I, 10, 33. Latin: &quot;[[summum ius, summa iniuria]]&quot;. For the translation given above, see, for example, Adler and Doren, Great Treasury of Western Thought, Bowker, 1977, p 851.&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist doctrine asserts that law will not be required once the state has [[Withering away of the state|withered away]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Withering away of the state&quot;.

==Definition==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}
===Whether it is possible or desirable to define law===
There have been many attempts to produce &quot;a universally acceptable definition of law&quot;. By 1972, no such definition had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. Introduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. Page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question &quot;what is law?&quot; has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. ISBN 1-85431-582-X. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word &quot;law&quot; depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, &quot;[[early customary law]]&quot; and &quot;[[municipal law]]&quot; were contexts where the word &quot;law&quot; was used with two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word &quot;Law&quot;. Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), Phillosophy, Politics and Society (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word &quot;law&quot; and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. The Symbols of Government. 1935. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word &quot;law&quot; (e.g. &quot;let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. Introduction to Jurisprudence. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed definitions===
One definition is that law is a [[system]] of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behavior&lt;!-- HIDDEN UNTIL VERIFIED  ,wherever possible--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes against humanity'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Concept of Law]]'' Hart argued law is a &quot;system of rules&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Contribution of Legal Studies'', 184&lt;/ref&gt; Austin said law was &quot;the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin describes law as an &quot;interpretive concept&quot; to achieve [[justice]];&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; and Raz argues law is an &quot;authority&quot; to mediate people's interests.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes said &quot;The prohecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Oliver Wendell. &quot;The Path of Law (1897) 10 Harvard Law Review 457 at 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas said that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Aquinas, St Thomas. Summa Theologica. 1a2ae, 90.4. Translated by J G Dawson. Ed d'Entreves. (Basil Blackwell). Latin: &quot;nihil est aliud qau edam rationis ordinatio ad bonum commune, ab eo qi curam communitatis habet, promulgata&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has both positivist and naturalist elements.&lt;ref&gt;McCoubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. Textbook on Jurisprudence. Second Edition. Blackstone Press Limited. 1996. ISBN 1-85431-582-X. Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal subjects==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between &quot;[[public law]]&quot; (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and &quot;[[private law]]&quot; (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that &quot;the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred&quot;, and that this distinction has become mere &quot;folklore&quot; (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the &quot;traditional core subjects&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a &quot;qualifying law degree&quot;. For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]] .

===International law===
{{Main|Public international law|Conflict of laws|European Union law}}
[[File:Naciones Unidas 3.jpg|right|thumb|Providing a constitution for public international law, the United Nations system was agreed during World War II]]

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.

*'''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent the Second World War),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN], United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: &quot;It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially &quot;self help&quot;; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court], 32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or &quot;private international law&quot; in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organisation]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes &quot;a new legal order of international law&quot; for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional and administrative law===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], whose principles still have constitutional value]]

Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A &quot;constitution&quot; is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything but that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can apply for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions by local councils, public services or government ministries, to ensure that they comply with the law. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;A75&quot;&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal law===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevents people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;W2&quot;&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Br2&quot;&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However for so called &quot;[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]&quot; crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 1600s criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of &quot;[[necessity]]&quot;. The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17 year old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, &quot;to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it.&quot; The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC], see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;W2&quot; /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as &quot;''The People'' v ...&quot; or &quot;''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...&quot; Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute], International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract law===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good consideration for it by going to the &quot;distinct inconvenience&quot; of using a faulty product. &quot;Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will&quot;, said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], &quot;here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCSBCE&quot;&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Consideration&quot; indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. In Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html § 311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; or a &quot;concurrence of wills&quot;. [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html § 105 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tort law===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:AntiMcDonaldsLeicesterSqLondon20041016 CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|The &quot;[[McDonald's Restaurants v Morris &amp; Steel|McLibel]]&quot; two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for his injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DvS&quot;&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence; (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]], or not too [[Remoteness in English Law|remote]] a consequence, of her harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;DvS&quot; /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturges&quot;&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Property law===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]]s, [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper (&quot;finders keeper&quot;) until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [http://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our &quot;lives, liberties and estates&quot; are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity and trusts===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the &quot;common law&quot;. The common law was administered by judges. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed ... This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

===Further disciplines===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:UnisonStrikeRallyOxford20060328 KaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]

* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in allmember states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon], The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''Intellectual property''' law aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an &quot;absence of basis&quot; for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing Space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialization]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation

* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of [[consumer welfare]].
* '''[[Consumer protection|Consumer law]]''' could include anything from regulations on unfair [[contractual terms]] and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.
* '''[[Environmental law]]''' is increasingly important, especially in light of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the potential danger of [[climate change]]. Environmental protection also serves to penalise [[pollution|polluters]] within domestic legal systems.

==Legal systems==
{{Main|Legal systems of the world}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;civil law&quot; referring to a legal system should not be confused with &quot;civil law&quot; as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

===Civil law===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}
[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]]]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codification]]s in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as &quot;the other source of law&quot;; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of &quot;written law&quot; (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and &quot;unwritten law&quot; (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, &quot;Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[Canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; The United States follows the common law system described below.

===Common law and equity===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

Common law and equity are legal systems where decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged to be legal sources. The &quot;doctrine of precedent&quot;, or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for &quot;to stand by decisions&quot;) means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts. Common law systems also rely on statutes, passed by the legislature, but may make less of a systematic attempt to codify their laws than in a &quot;civil law&quot; system. Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] led to a unification of various tribal customs and hence a law &quot;common&quot; to the whole country. The common law developed when the English monarchy had been weakened by the enormous cost of fighting for control over large parts of France. [[John of England|King John]] had been forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This &quot;great charter&quot; or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at &quot;a certain place&quot; rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralised. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a rigid and inflexible system of common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticised as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; &quot;Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; But over time it developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century the two systems were fused into one another. In developing the common law and equity, academic authors have always played an important part. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to describe and teach it.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious law===
{{Main|Religious law}}

Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the &quot;path to follow&quot;—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Law of Israel|Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic Church, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AA&quot;&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name = Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia], Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[world politics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H1&quot;&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of law==

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice]]

The history of law is closely connected to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements (&quot;if ... then ...&quot;). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for &quot;law&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, &quot;Law&quot;, in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Constitution of the Athenians|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;St107&quot;&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty|Ch'ing dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of law===
{{Main|Philosophy of law}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=''&quot;But what, after all, is a law? [...] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. [...] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills.&quot;''|source=Jean-Jacques Rousseau, ''[[The Social Contract]]'', II, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''The Social Contract'', [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/r/rousseau/jean_jacques/r864s/book2.html#section16 Book II: Chapter 6 (Law)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence is essentially [[political philosophy]], and asks &quot;what should law be?&quot;, while analytic jurisprudence asks &quot;what is law?&quot; [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is &quot;commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jap&quot;&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of &quot;natural law&quot; emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in entanglement with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws &quot;be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|&quot;is&quot; and what &quot;ought to be&quot;]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from &quot;morality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;immoral&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with &quot;normativity&quot;; meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive &quot;is&quot; statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we &quot;should&quot; do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass of all political experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;F171&quot;&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''Law's Empire'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an &quot;[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''Law's Empire'', 410&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's &quot;soft social thesis&quot; approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jra&quot;&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic analysis of law===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established &quot;a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sturges&quot;/&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology of law===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jary&quot;&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], [[dispute processing]] and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as [[socio-legal studies]]. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his &quot;scientific&quot; approach to law, identifying the &quot;legal rational form&quot; as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jary&quot;/&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal institutions==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;H17&quot;&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

===Judiciary===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts], Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|right|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of &quot;judicial independence&quot; in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the &quot;criteria of Islam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislature===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riker101&quot;&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riker101&quot;/&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About &quot;cabinet accountability&quot; in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|right|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch]]
The executive in a legal system serves as a government's centre of political [[authority]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is chosen by the Prime Minister or [[Chancellor]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggard71&quot;&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany|German president]] (appointed by members of federal and state Parliaments) the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (a [[hereditary]] title), and the [[President of Austria|Austrian president]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in France, the U.S. and Russia. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggard71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Interior minister|interior ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

===Military and police===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organizations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, &quot;If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces], History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mwp154&quot;&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bureaucracy===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 192 member states.]]

The etymology of &quot;bureaucracy&quot; derives from the French word for &quot;office&quot; (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word &quot;power&quot; (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over &quot;officialdom&quot; is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [http://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name=&quot;K367&quot;&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of &quot;[[red tape]]&quot; aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name=&quot;K367&quot; /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name=&quot;mwp393&quot;&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, management is composed of career experts, who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal profession===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to be able to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of an [[barrister|advocate]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor (solicitor).&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] or a [[Juris Doctor]] [[academic degree|degree]]&lt;ref&gt;Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). Most Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally-trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or through freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fine364&quot;&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fine364&quot;/&gt;

===Civil society===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|U.S. Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

[[Classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of &quot;civil society&quot; dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have &quot;a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the &quot;state&quot; from &quot;civil society&quot; (''burgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economics''' is the [[Social sciences|social science]] that analyzes the [[Production theory basics|production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. The term ''economics'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἰκονομία|οἰκονομία]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|oikonomia}}'', &quot;management of a household, administration&quot;) from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος|οἶκος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|oikos}}'', &quot;house&quot;) + {{lang|grc|[[wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|nomos}}'', &quot;custom&quot; or &quot;law&quot;), hence &quot;rules of the house(hold)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Harper | title = Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Economy | month = November | year = 2001 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economy | accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political economy]] was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested &quot;economics&quot; as a shorter term for &quot;economic science&quot; that also avoided a narrow ''political-interest'' connotation and as similar in form to &quot;[[mathematics]]&quot;, &quot;ethics&quot;, and so forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallJevons&quot;&gt;• [[Alfred Marshall|Marshall, Alfred]], and [[Mary Paley Marshall]] (1879). ''The Economics of Industry'', Macmillan, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=wFc4yr9xfqAC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons, W.

A focus of the subject is how [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] behave or interact and how [[economy|economies]] work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics. [[Microeconomics]] examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions. [[Macroeconomics]] analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy.

Other broad distinctions include those between [[positive economics]] (describing &quot;what is&quot;) and [[normative economics]] (advocating &quot;what ought to be&quot;); between economic theory and [[applied economics]]; between [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and [[behavioral economics]]; and between [[mainstream economics]] (more &quot;orthodox&quot; and dealing with the &quot;rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus&quot;) and [[heterodox economics]] (more &quot;radical&quot; and dealing with the &quot;institutions-history-social structure nexus&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Caplin and Andrew Schotter, ''The Foundations of Positive and Normative Economics'', Oxford University Press, 2008, ISBN 0-19-532831-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, John B.

==Definitions==
There are a variety of modern [[definitions of economics]]. Some of the differences may reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backhouse&quot;&gt;• [[Roger E. Backhouse|Backhouse, Roger E.]], and Steven Medema (2008). &quot;economics, definition of&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, pp. 720–22. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000291&amp;q=definitions&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=5 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • _____ (2009). &quot;Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics&quot;, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 23(1), pp. [http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.23.1.221 221–33].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland|Scottish]] philosopher [[Adam Smith]] (1776) defined what was then called [[political economy]] as &quot;an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations&quot;, in particular as:
:a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people&amp;nbsp;... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groenwegen&quot;&gt;Smith, Adam (1776). ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'', and Book IV, as quoted in Peter Groenwegen (1987) [[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|[2008]]]), &quot;'political economy' and 'economics'&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, p. 905 [pp.&amp;nbsp;904–07 (brief [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=%22political+economy+and+economics%22+Groenewegen&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Baptiste Say|J.-B. Say]] (1803), distinguishing the subject from its [[public policy|public-policy]] uses, defines it as the science ''of'' production, distribution, and consumption of [[wealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy; or the Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth'', trans. 1834, C. C. Biddle, ed., Grigg and Elliot.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[satirical]] side, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1849) coined &quot;[[the dismal science]]&quot; as an [[Epithet#Alternative contemporary usage|epithet]] for [[classical economics]], in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of [[Malthus]] (1798).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismal&quot;&gt;• [Carlyle, Thomas] (1849). &quot;Occasional Discourse on the N[egro] Question&quot;, ''Fraser's Magazine'', republished in ''Works of Thomas Carlyle'', 1904, v. 29, Charles Scribner's Sons, pp. 348–383.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Malthus, Thomas (1798). ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]].''&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Persky, Joseph (1990). &quot;Retrospectives: A Dismal Romantic&quot;, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 4(4), pp. 166–169 [pp. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/1942728 165]-172].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]] (1844) defines the subject in a social context as:
:The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1844). &quot;On the Definition of Political Economy; and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It&quot;, [http://www.econlib.org/library/Mill/mlUQP5.html Essay V], in ''Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy'' (V39). (Accessed Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890) that extends analysis beyond [[Economic wealth|wealth]] and from the [[societal]] to the [[microeconomic]] level:
:Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred (1890 [1920]). ''Principles of Political Economy'', v. 1, pp. 1–2 [8th ed.]. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lionel Robbins]] (1932) developed implications of what has been termed &quot;[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven Medema (2009). &quot;Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics&quot;, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 23(1), p. 225. [pp. [http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.23.1.221 221–33.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Economics is a science which studies [[human behaviour]] as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel (1932). ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 15]. London: Macmillan. Links for [http://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 1932 HTML] and 2nd ed., [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14242989/An-Essay-on-the-Nature-and-Signicance-of-Economic-Science-Lionel-Robbins- 1935 facsimile].&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins describes the definition as not ''classificatory'' in &quot;pick[ing] out certain ''kinds'' of behaviour&quot; but rather ''analytical'' in &quot;focus[ing] attention on a particular ''aspect'' of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of [[scarcity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Lionel (1932). ''An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science'', p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 16].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behavior and [[rational choice|rational-choice]] modeling [[Economic imperialism (economics)|expanded the domain]] of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backhouse2009Stigler&quot;&gt;• Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven G.

[[Gary Becker]], a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favors as &quot;combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behavior, stable [[preference (economics)|preference]]s, and [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]], used relentlessly and unﬂinchingly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Gary S. (1976).

Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, Roger E., and Steven Medema (2009). &quot;Retrospectives: On the Definition of Economics&quot;, ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 23(1), p. 229, Introduction, and Conclusion [pp. [http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.23.1.221 221–33].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microeconomics==
{{Main|Microeconomics}}

=== Economic development===
[[Economic development]] refers to not only increase in the output and growth of an economy but includes the various changes in the institutional arrangements through which output is generated. Economic Development refers to the achievement of a new equilibrium over the previously attained [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]].  It is a micro economic concept with direct relation to Economic [[Economic growth|Growth]] as Growth can be achieved with or without development but Economic Development always results in growth.

===Markets===
[[File:Ballard Farmers' Market - vegetables.jpg|thumb|Economists study trade, production and consumption decisions, such as those that occur in a traditional [[marketplace]].|alt=A vegetable vendor in a marketplace.]]
[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|right| In [[Virtual Markets]], buyer and seller are not present and trade via intermediates and electronic information. Pictured: [[São Paulo Stock Exchange]].|alt=Two men sit at computer monitors with financial information]]
Microeconomics is the study of economics analysing individual players of a market and the [[Market structure|structure]] of such markets. It deals with, as its irreducible base unit, private, public and domestic players. Microeconomics studies how these players interact with each other through individual markets (assuming that there is a scarcity of tradable units and [[government regulation]]. A [[market]] might deal with a ''product'' (such as apples, aluminium and mobile phones), or with ''services of a [[factor of production]]'', (brick laying, book printing, food packaging). Microeconomics theory considers the [[Aggregation problem|aggregates]] (the sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers, studying each possible price per unit (i.e. supply and demand). It studies the complex interaction between market players both through buying and selling. Theory holds that markets may reach [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] between &quot;quantity demanded&quot; and &quot;quantity supplied&quot; (supply and demand) over time.

Microeconomics also examines various market structures. [[Perfect competition]] describes a market structure such that no participants are large enough to have the [[market power]] to set the price of a homogeneous product. Another way of putting this is to say a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a &quot;price taker&quot;, and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells. [[Imperfect competition]] refers to market structures where the conditions of perfect competition do not exist. Forms of imperfect competition include: [[monopoly]] (in which there is only one seller of a good), [[duopoly]] (in which there are only two sellers of a good), [[oligopoly]] (in which there are few sellers of a good), [[monopolistic competition]] (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), [[monopsony]] (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and [[oligopsony]] (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be &quot;price makers&quot;, which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.

Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as [[supply and demand|partial-equilibrium]] analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. [[General equilibrium|General-equilibrium]] theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Mark Blaug|Blaug, Mark]] (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, Microeconomics, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, pp. 347–49.

{{Main|Production theory basics|Opportunity cost|Economic efficiency|Production-possibility frontier}}
In microeconomics, [[Production (economics)|production]] is the conversion of [[factor of production|inputs]] into [[Output (economics)|outputs]]. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a [[good (economics)|commodity]] for [[trade|exchange]] or direct use. Production is a [[Stock and flow|flow]] and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment goods]] (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), [[public good]]s (national defense, small-pox vaccinations, etc.) or [[private good]]s (new computers, bananas, etc.), and [[Guns versus butter model|&quot;guns&quot; vs. &quot;butter&quot;]].

[[Opportunity cost]] refers to the [[economic cost]] of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet [[mutually exclusive]] actions. It has been described as expressing &quot;the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[choice]].&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. Buchanan|Buchanan, James M.]] (1987). &quot;opportunity cost&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 718–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|output forgone]], [[leisure]], or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ([[utility]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]], Economics A-Z, ''[http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST &quot;Opportunity Cost.&quot;] Accessed 3 Aug. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Inputs used in the production process include such primary [[factors of production]] as [[Labour (economics)|labour services]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and [[Land (economics)|land]] (including natural resources). Other inputs may include [[intermediate good]]s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.

[[Economic efficiency]] describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available [[technology]]. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of &quot;waste&quot; is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is [[Pareto efficiency]], which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|left|An example PPF with illustrative points marked]] The [[production-possibility frontier]] (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an [[economy]] can produce just two goods (say &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;butter&quot;). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows [[Potential output|potential total output]] for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.

[[Scarcity]] is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;Montani, Guido (1987), &quot;scarcity&quot;, [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 4, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an [[inverse relationship]]. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter. The [[slope]] of the curve at a point on it gives the [[trade-off#Examples from common life|trade-off]] between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a [[market economy]], movement along the curve may indicate that the [[utility|choice]] of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.

By construction, each point on the curve shows ''[[productive efficiency]]'' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high [[unemployment]] during a [[business cycle|business-cycle]] [[recession]] or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy [[allocative efficiency]] (also called [[Pareto efficiency]]) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.

Much [[applied economics]] in [[public policy]] is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the &quot;essence of economics&quot;, where the subject &quot;makes its unique contribution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Paul A.|last=Samuelson|authorlink2=William Nordhaus|last2=William D.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialization===
{{Main|Division of labour|Comparative advantage|Gains from trade}}
Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and [[empirical]] considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in [[stock and flow|stocks]] of [[human capital]] per worker or [[capital (economics)|capital]]/[[labor force|labour]] ratios. According to theory, this may give a [[comparative advantage]] in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input. Even if one region has an [[absolute advantage]] as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.

It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of [[Returns to scale|scale]] and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration]] to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul R.]] (1980). &quot;Scale Economies, Product Differentiation, and the Pattern of Trade&quot;, ''American Economic Review'', 70(5), pp. [http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/scale_econ.pdf 950–59.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • William C.

[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000064&amp;q=agglomeration&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, [[Service (economics)|service]] providers, and [[economy|economies]]. Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding ''[[division of labour]]'' with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] and differentiated [[Land (economics)|land]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;• Groenewegen, Peter (2008). &quot;division of labour&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''.

An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.

Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market [[price]]s of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|low-cost]] inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a [[invisible hand|by-product]] or by [[mechanism design|design]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rondo Cameron|Cameron, Rondo]] (1993, 2nd ed.). ''A Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present, Oxford, pp. 25, 32, 276–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Such specialization of production creates opportunities for ''[[gains from trade]]'' whereby resource owners benefit from [[trade]] in the sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods. A measure of gains from trade is the ''increased income levels'' that trade may facilitate.&lt;ref&gt;• Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004).

===Supply and demand===
{{Main|Supply and demand}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase (that is, right-shift) in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).|alt=A graph depicting Quantity on the X-axis and Price on the Y-axis]]

[[Prices and quantities]] have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a [[market]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, A. (1987). &quot;prices and quantities&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In [[microeconomics]], it applies to price and output determination for a market with [[perfect competition]], which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [[market power|power]].

For a given market of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|commodity]], ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). [[consumer theory|Demand theory]] describes individual consumers as [[rational choice theory|rationally]] choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is &quot;constrained utility maximization&quot; (with income and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as the [[budget constraint|constraints]] on demand). Here, [[utility]] refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.

The [[law of demand]] states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy of it (other things [[ceteris paribus|unchanged]]). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [[substitution effect]]). In addition, [[purchasing power]] from the price decline increases ability to buy (the [[income effect]]). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.

''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit-maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a directly proportional relation between price and quantity supplied (other things unchanged). That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The &quot;Law of Supply&quot; states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.

[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.

For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or [[marginal utility]], to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Baumol|Baumol, William J.]] (2007). &quot;Economic Theory&quot;, Measurement and ordinal utility, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 17, p. 719.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding point on the supply curve measures [[marginal cost]], the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Value and Capital]]| last=Hicks| first=J.R.| authorlink=John Hicks| year=1939| publisher=Oxford University Press. 2nd ed., paper, 2001| location=London| isbn=978-0-19-828269-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) ''variable'' in the [[short run]], which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively ''fixed'', such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the [[long run]], all inputs may be adjusted by [[management]]. These distinctions translate to differences in the [[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity]] (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.

[[marginalism|Marginalist theory]], such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to [[Income#Meaning in economics and use in economic theory|income]] and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares [[marginal revenue]] (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the [[marginal cost]] of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change &quot;at the margin&quot;: more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.

Other applications of demand and supply include the [[Distribution (economics)|distribution of income]] among the [[factors of production]], including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive [[labour market]] for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model&amp;nbsp;— Demand|demand for labour]] (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers). [[Labour economics]] examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, [[labour mobility]], and (un)employment, productivity through [[human capital]], and related public-policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard B. Freeman|Freeman, R.B.]] (1987). &quot;labour economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 72–76.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Taber, Christopher, and Bruce A. Weinberg (2008). &quot;labour economics (new perspectives)&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_L000241&amp;q=labor%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=14 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Hicks, J.R. (1963, 2nd ed.). ''[[The Theory of Wages]]''. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behavior of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the [[economy]], for example, total output (estimated as [[real GDP]]) and the general [[price level]], as studied in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Olivier Blanchard|Blanchard, Olivier]] (2006, 4th ed.). ''Macroeconomics'', ch. 7, &quot;Putting All Markets Together: The AS–AD Model&quot;, Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing the [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in [[applied economics]]. Economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient mechanism for allocating resources.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, J.S. (1982). &quot;The Competitive Allocation Process Is Informationally Efficient Uniquely.&quot; ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 28(1), p. 1–18.

===Firms===
{{Main|Theory of the firm|Industrial organization|Business economics|Managerial economics}}

People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through ''firms''. The most obvious kinds of firms are [[corporation]]s, [[partnerships]] and [[trusts]]. According to [[Ronald Coase]] people begin to organise their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater [[economies of scale]] (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. [[Industrial organization]] generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behavior of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include [[monopolistic competition]], various forms of [[oligopoly]], and [[monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmalensee, Richard (1987). &quot;Industrial Organization&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, pp. 803–808.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Managerial economics]] applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as [[operations research]] and programming and from statistical methods such as [[regression analysis]] in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] business decisions, including unit-cost minimization and profit maximization, given the firm's objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;• NA (2007). &quot;managerial economics&quot;. {{cite book | title= The New Encyclopædia Britannica| date=| pages=v. 7, p. 757| publisher=The New Encyclopædia Britannica| location=Chicago| isbn=0-85229-423-9}}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Hughes, Alan (1987). &quot;managerial capitalism&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 293–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty and game theory ===
{{Main|Information economics|Game theory|Financial economics}}
[[Uncertainty]] in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as [[Risk#Risk versus uncertainty|risk]] or not. Without it, household behavior would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, [[financial market|financial]] and [[capital market]]s would reduce to exchange of a single [[financial instrument|instrument]] in each market period, and there would be no [[communication]]s industry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark J. Machina|Machina, Mark J.]] and [[Michael Rothschild]] (2008). &quot;risk&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000152&amp;edition=current&amp;q=risk&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents' responses to it.&lt;ref&gt;Wakker, Peter P. (2008) &quot;uncertainty&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000005&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Uncertainty&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] that considers [[Strategy#Strategies in game theory|strategic interactions]] between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical [[microfoundation|foundation]] of [[industrial organization]], discussed above, to model different types of firm behavior, for example in an [[oligopolist]]ic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining]], [[Contract theory|contract design]], and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. As a method heavily used in [[behavioral economics]], it postulates that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] choose strategies to maximize their payoffs, given the strategies of other agents with at least partially conflicting interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;SamUn&quot;&gt;Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004). ''Economics'', 18th ed., ch. 11, &quot;Uncertainty and Game Theory&quot; and [end] Glossary of Terms, &quot;Economics of information&quot;, &quot;Game theory&quot;, and &quot;Regulation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin F. Camerer]] (2003). ''Behavioral Game Theory'' [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.html Description] and ch. 1 [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7517.pdf link] (scroll down). Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; In this, it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyze market actors such as in the [[supply and demand]] model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]. It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of [[nuclear strategies]], [[Game theory#Philosophy|ethics]], [[Game theory#Political science|political science]], and [[evolutionary biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Aumann|Aumann, R.J.]] (2008). &quot;game theory&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''.

[[Risk aversion]] may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for [[insurance]], commodity [[futures market|futures contracts]], and [[financial instruments]]. [[Financial economics]] or simply [[finance]] describes the allocation of financial resources. It also analyzes the pricing of financial instruments, the [[capital structure|financial structure]] of companies, the efficiency and fragility of [[financial market]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Bernanke|Bernanke, Ben]] and [[Mark Gertler (economist)|Mark Gertler]] (1990). &quot;Financial Fragility and Economic Performance&quot;, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 105(1), p [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2937820 p. 87]-114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Financial crisis|financial crises]], and related government policy or [[Financial regulation|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;From (2008), ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Ross, Stephen A.]] &quot;finance.&quot; [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000071&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Finance&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Burnside, Craig, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo. &quot;currency crises models.&quot; [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000204&amp;edition=current&amp;q=crisis&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Kaminsky, Graciela Laura. &quot;currency crises.&quot; [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000468&amp;edition=current&amp;q=crisis&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=10 Abstract.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Calomiris, Charles W. &quot;banking crises.&quot; [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_B000051&amp;edition=current&amp;q=crisis&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=18 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on [[George Akerlof]]'s &quot;[[Market for Lemons]]&quot; article, the [[paradigm]] example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a &quot;lemon&quot; depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, George A. (1970). &quot;The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism&quot;, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 84(3), pp. [http://hydrogen.its.ucdavis.edu/eec/education/EEC-classes/eeclimate/class-readings/akerlof-the%20market%20for%20lemons.pdf 488–500.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information asymmetry]] arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are [[adverse selection]], such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and [[moral hazard]], such that insurance results in riskier behavior (say more reckless driving). Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency in driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (&quot;[[incomplete markets]]&quot;). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard.

===Market failure===
{{Main|Market failure|Government failure|Information economics|Environmental economics|Agricultural economics}}
[[File:Smokestack in Detroit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pollution]] can be a simple example of market failure. If [[costs of production]] are not borne by producers but are by the environment, accident victims or others, then prices are distorted.|alt=A smokestack releasing smoke]]

The term &quot;[[market failure]]&quot; encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorise market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.&lt;ref&gt;• Cf. [[Nicholas Barr]] (2004), whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions, which are (1) producers as price takers (i.e. presence of oligopoly or monopoly; but why is this not a product of the following?) (2) equal power of consumers (what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power) (3) complete markets (4) public goods (5) external effects (i.e. externalities?) (6) increasing returns to scale (i.e. practical monopoly) (7) perfect information [in his ''Economics of the Welfare State'', 4th ed., Oxford University Press, pp. 72–79].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (2000) classifies market failures as from failure of competition (including [[natural monopoly]]), [[information asymmetries]], [[incomplete markets]], [[externalities]], [[public good]] situations, and [[macroeconomic]] disturbances (in his ''Economics of the Public Sector'', 3rd ed., Ch.4, W.W. Norton).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Information asymmetries]] and [[incomplete markets]] may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.

[[Natural monopoly]], or the overlapping concepts of &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;technical&quot; monopoly, is an extreme case of ''failure of competition'' as a restraint on producers. The problem is described as one where the more of a product is made, the lower the unit costs are. This means it only makes economic sense to have one producer.

[[Public goods]] are goods which are undersupplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.

[[Externalities]] occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price [[distortions (economics)|distortions]] caused by these externalities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|Laffont, J.J.]] (1987). &quot;externalities&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, p. 263–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Blaug|Blaug, Mark]] (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica''v. 27, p. 347. Chicago. ISBN 0-85229-423-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In many areas, some form of [[price stickiness]] is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the [[business cycle]] in [[macroeconomics]]. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets [[Imperfect competition|deviating]] from [[perfect competition]].

[[Macroeconomics|Macroeconomic instability]], addressed below, is a prime source of market failure, whereby a general loss of business confidence or external shock can grind production and distribution to a halt, undermining ordinary markets that are otherwise sound.

[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|[[Environmental scientist]] sampling water|alt=A woman takes samples of water from a river]]

Some specialised fields of economics deal in market failure more than others. The [[economics of the public sector]] is one example, since where markets fail, some kind of regulatory or government programme is the remedy. Much [[environmental economics]] concerns externalities or &quot;[[public bad]]s&quot;.

[[Policy]] options include regulations that reflect [[cost-benefit analysis]] or market solutions that change incentives, such as [[Emissions trading|emission fees]] or redefinition of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;• Kneese, Allen K., and Clifford S. Russell (1987). &quot;environmental economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 2, pp. 159–64.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Samuelson, Paul A., and [[William Nordhaus|William D. Nordhaus]] (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', ch. 18, &quot;Protecting the Environment.&quot; McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sector===
{{Main|Economics of the public sector|Public finance}}
{{See also|Welfare economics}}
Public finance is the field of economics that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a [[public sector]] entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as [[tax incidence]] (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programs, effects on [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]] of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of [[public choice theory]], models public-sector behavior analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Musgrave|Musgrave, R.A.]] (1987). &quot;public finance&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 1055–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of economics is [[positive economics|positive]], seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. [[Normative economics]] seeks to identify what economies ''ought'' to be like.

Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] techniques to simultaneously determine the [[allocative efficiency]] within an economy and the income [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] associated with it. It attempts to measure [[social welfare]] by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Allan M. (1987). &quot;welfare economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 4, pp. 889–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomics==
[[File:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|right|thumb|Circulation in Macroeconomics]]
{{Main|Macroeconomics}}

Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions &quot;top down&quot;, that is, using a simplified form of [[General equilibrium|general-equilibrium]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggregates include [[measures of national income and output|national income and output]], the [[unemployment rate]], and price [[inflation]] and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]]. 

Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to [[microfoundations|micro-based]] modeling of sectors, including [[rational expectations|rationality]] of players, [[Efficient market hypothesis|efficient use]] of market information, and [[imperfect competition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yew-Kwang Ng|Ng, Yew-Kwang]] (1992). &quot;Business Confidence and Depression Prevention: A Mesoeconomic Perspective&quot;, ''American Economic Review'' 82(2), pp. 365–371. [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282%28199205%2982%3A2%3C365%3ABCADPA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-4&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage]&lt;/ref&gt; This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;Howitt, Peter M. (1987). &quot;Macroeconomics: Relations with Microeconomics&quot;.{{cite book | title=[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], pp. 273–76| publisher=Macmillan and Stockton| location=London and New York| isbn=0-333-37235-2 | author=edited by John Eatwell, Murray Milgate, Peter Newman. | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and [[economic growth|growth]] of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, [[Technological change#Economics|technological change]] and [[labour force]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, Macroeconomics, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
{{Main|Economic growth}}
[[File:Gdp real growth rate 2007 CIA Factbook.PNG|thumb|World map showing [[List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate|GDP real growth rates]]|alt=A world map with countries colored in different shades of orange]]
''Growth economics'' studies factors that explain [[economic growth]]&amp;nbsp;– the increase in output [[per capita]] of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the ''level'' of output per capita ''between'' countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries [[catch-up effect|converge]] at the same rates of growth.

Much-studied factors include the rate of [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment]], [[population growth]], and [[Technological change#Economics|technological change]]. These are represented in theoretical and [[empirical]] forms (as in the [[neoclassical growth model|neoclassical]] and [[endogenous growth model|endogenous]] growth models) and in [[growth accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;• Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', ch. 27, &quot;The Process of Economic Growth&quot; McGraw-Hill. ISBN 0-07-287205-5.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Hirofumi Uzawa|Uzawa, H.]] (1987). &quot;models of growth&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 483–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycle===
{{Main|Business cycle}}
{{See also|Circular flow of income|Aggregate supply|Aggregate demand|Unemployment|Great Depression}}
The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of &quot;macroeconomics&quot; as a separate discipline field of study. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] authored a book entitled ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' outlining the key theories of [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes contended that [[aggregate demand]] for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.

He therefore advocated active policy responses by the [[public sector]], including [[monetary policy]] actions by the [[central bank]] and [[fiscal policy]] actions by the government to stabilize output over the [[business cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards [[full employment]] levels. [[John Hicks]]' [[IS/LM]] model has been the most influential interpretation of ''The General Theory''.

Over the years, understanding of the [[business cycle]] has branched into various [[research program]]s, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The [[neoclassical synthesis]] refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with [[neoclassical economics]], stating that Keynesianism is correct in the [[short run]] but qualified by neoclassical-like considerations in the intermediate and [[long run]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard2008&quot;&gt;[[Olivier J. Blanchard|Blanchard, Olivier Jean]] ([1987] 2008), &quot;neoclassical synthesis,&quot; ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000041&amp;q=neoclassical&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=2 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New classical macroeconomics]], as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits [[market clearing]] with [[imperfect information]]. It includes Friedman's [[permanent income hypothesis]] on consumption and &quot;[[rational expectations]]&quot; theory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist.pdf The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer], Gregory Mankiw, Harvard University, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; lead by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], and [[real business cycle theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Fischer|Fischer, Stanley]] (2008). &quot;new classical macroeconomics,&quot; ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000056&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Contents].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[New Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of [[market failures]]. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are &quot;[[Sticky (economics)|sticky]]&quot;, which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon2008&quot;&gt;Dixon, Huw David (2008). &quot;new Keynesian macroeconomics,&quot; ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000166&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the &quot;long run&quot; may be very long.

=== Unemployment ===
{{Main|Unemployment}}
[[File:US employment 1995-2012.png|thumb|Percent of US population employed, 1995–2012]]
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or [[discouraged worker|discouraged from seeking work]] by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labor force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes. Classical unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (2008). http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000311.&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt; While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. [[Okun's law]] represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, 445-446.&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Christopher J. &quot;Okun's Law: Output and Unemployment. ''Economic Synopses''. Number 4. 2010. http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1004.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and monetary policy===
{{Main|Inflation|Monetary policy}}
{{See also|Money|Quantity theory of money|Monetary policy|History of money}}

[[Money]] is a ''means of final payment'' for goods in most [[price system]] economies and the [[unit of account]] in which prices are typically stated. A very apt statement by Professor Walker, a well-known economist is that, &quot; Money is what money does.&quot; Money has a general acceptability, a relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elastic in supply and survives with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others.
[[File:Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Federal Reserve]] sets monetary policy as the [[central bank]] of the United States.]]
As a [[medium of exchange]], money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with [[barter]] (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate [[double coincidence of wants]] as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the [[transaction cost]] of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Tobin|Tobin, James]] (1992). &quot;Money&quot; (Money as a Social Institution and Public Good), ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Finance and Money'', v. 2, pp. 770–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of an [[economy]], [[quantity theory of money|theory]] and evidence are consistent with a [[positive relationship]] running from the total [[money supply]] to the [[nominal value]] of total output and to the general [[price level]]. For this reason, management of the [[money supply]] is a key aspect of [[monetary policy]].&lt;ref&gt;• [[Milton Friedman]] (1987). &quot;quantity theory of money&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 4, pp. 15–19.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004). ''Economics'', ch. 2, &quot;Money: The Lubroicant of Exchange&quot; section, ch. 33, Fig. 33–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal policy===
{{Main|Fiscal policy|Government spending}}

Governments implement fiscal policy by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an [[output gap]] where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government. For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have [[Fiscal multiplier|multiplier effects]] where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity. 

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed. Skeptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of [[Ricardian equivalence]]. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from fiscal policy will be offset by the increased savings rate intended to pay for future higher taxes.

==International economics==
{{Main|International economics|Economic system}}
International trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of [[gains from trade]]. Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing [[tariff]] rates and trade quotas. [[International finance]] is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] across international borders, and the effects of these movements on [[exchange rate]]s. Increased trade in goods, services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;• Anderson, James E.

The distinct field of ''[[development economics]]'' examines economic aspects of the development process in relatively [[developing countries|low-income countries]] focusing on [[structural change]], [[poverty]], and [[economic growth]]. Approaches in development economics frequently incorporate social and political factors.&lt;ref&gt;• Bell, Clive (1987). &quot;development economics&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 818–26.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, Growth and development, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 351.

Economic systems is the [[JEL classification codes#Economic systems JEL: P Subcategories|branch]] of economics that studies the methods and [[institutions]] by which societies determine the ownership, direction, and allocation of economic resources. An ''economic system'' of a society is the unit of analysis.

Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are [[Planned economy|socialist systems]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]], in which most production occurs in respectively state-run and private enterprises. In between are [[mixed economies]]. A common element is the interaction of economic and political influences, broadly described as [[Political economy#Current approaches|political economy]]. ''[[Comparative economic systems]]'' studies the relative performance and behavior of different economies or systems.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Robert L. Heilbroner|Heilbroner, Robert L.]] and Peter J.

==Practice==
{{Main|Economic methodology|Mathematical economics|Schools of economics}}
Contemporary economics uses mathematics. Economists draw on the tools of [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[statistics]], [[game theory]], and [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Debreu|Debreu, Gérard]] (1987). &quot;mathematical economics&quot;, ''The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 401–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools, while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods.

===Theory===
Mainstream economic theory relies upon [[wikt:a priori|a priori]] quantitative [[model (economics)|economic models]], which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration. When creating theories, the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman Milton]] (1953). &quot;[[Essays in Positive Economics#The Methodology of Positive Economics|The Methodology of Positive Economics]]&quot;, ''Essays in Positive Economics'', University of Chicago Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], principal concepts include [[supply and demand]], [[marginalism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[opportunity cost]], [[budget constraint]]s, [[utility]], and the [[theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;Boland, Lawrence A. (1987). &quot;methodology&quot;, ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 3, pp. 455–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dissension&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Frey, Bruno S., Werner W.

The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models&amp;nbsp;– for instance, in [[monetary theory]], the [[quantity theory of money]] predicts that increases in the [[money supply]] increase [[inflation]], and inflation is assumed to be influenced by [[rational expectations]]. In [[development economics]], slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the [[Four Asian Tigers]]. Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only ''[[qualitative economics|qualitative]]'', not ''quantitative''.&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, James (1987). &quot;qualitative economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 4, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, [[Paul Samuelson]]'s treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947) used mathematical methods to represent the theory, particularly as to maximizing behavioral relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called ''operationally meaningful theorems'' in economics, which are [[theorem]]s that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foundations&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]], Enlarged Edition| last=Samuelson| first=Paul A.| authorlink=Paul Samuelson| date=1947, 1983| page=4| publisher=Harvard University Press| location=Boston| isbn=978-0-674-31301-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

312 pages, page 13: &quot;...in economics, controlled experiments are rare and reproducible controlled experiments even more so...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and instead broad data is [[observational study|observationally studied]]; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of [[experimental economics]] is growing, and increasing use is being made of [[natural experiments]].

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]] such as [[regression analysis]] are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and [[statistical significance]] (&quot;signal strength&quot;) of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, [[data set]]s, and prior beliefs.

Criticism based on professional standards and non-[[Replication (statistics)|replicability]] of results serve as further checks against bias, errors, and over-generalization,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dissension&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot; ( Methods of inference and Testing theories), ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; although much economic research has been accused of being non-replicable, and prestigious journals have been accused of not facilitating replication through the provision of the code and data.&lt;ref name=McCullough2007&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCullough, B.D. | year = 2007 | title = Got Replicability?

In applied economics, [[input-output model]]s employing [[linear programming]] methods are quite common. Large amounts of data are run through computer programs to analyze the impact of certain policies; [[Minnesota IMPLAN Group|IMPLAN]] is one well-known example.

[[Experimental economics]] has promoted the use of [[Scientific control|scientifically controlled]] [[experiment]]s. This has reduced long-noted distinction of economics from [[natural science]]s allowed direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms.&lt;ref&gt;• [Bastable, C.F.] (1925). &quot;experimental methods in economics&quot;, ''Palgrave's Dictionary of Economics'', reprinted in ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'' (1987, v. 2, p. 241.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Vernon L.

In [[behavioral economics]], psychologist [[Daniel Kahneman]] won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for his and [[Amos Tversky]]'s empirical discovery of several [[cognitive bias]]es and [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]].

The professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programs on the subject, has been described as &quot;the main change in economics since around 1900&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orley Ashenfelter|O. Ashenfelter]] (2001), &quot;Economics: Overview&quot;, The Profession of Economics, ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 6, p. 4159.&lt;/ref&gt; Most major [[universities]] and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which [[academic degrees]] are awarded in the subject, whether in the [[liberal arts]], business, or for professional study; see [[Master of Economics]].

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics) is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field. In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including [[banking]] and [[finance]]. Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national [[Treasury]], [[Central Bank]] or [[Bureau of Statistics]].

The [[sociological]] subfield of [[economic sociology]] arose, primarily through the work of [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], as an approach to analysing the effects of economic phenomena in relation to the overarching social paradigm (i.e. [[modernity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7525.html |title=Principles of Economic Sociology by Richard Swedberg – An extract |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic works include [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and [[Georg Simmel]]'s ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900).

Two groups, later called &quot;mercantilists&quot; and &quot;physiocrats&quot;, more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of [[economic nationalism]] and [[History of capitalism#Merchant capitalism and mercantilism|modern capitalism]] in Europe. [[Mercantilism]] was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;• NA (2007). &quot;mercantilism&quot;, {{cite book | title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica| date=| pages=v. 8, p. 26| publisher=| id=}}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physiocrats]], a group of 18th century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a [[circular flow]] of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of [[laissez-faire]], which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;NA (2007). &quot;physiocrat&quot;, {{cite book | title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica| date=| pages=v. 9, p. 414.| publisher=| id=}}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Blaug, Mark (1997, 5th ed.)

ISBN 0-7656-0606-2&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system &quot;with all its imperfections&quot; as &quot;perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published&quot; on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=QV2OJqbt45oC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The making of modern economics: the lives and ideas of the great thinkers]''&quot;.

Publication of [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, has been described as &quot;the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaug&quot;&gt;[[Mark Blaug|Blaug, Mark]] (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;. ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The book identified land, labor, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation's wealth, as distinct from the Physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive.

:He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam (1776). ''The Wealth of Nations'', Bk.

The [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1798) used the idea of diminishing returns to explain low living standards. [[Human population]], he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;[Malthus, Thomas] (1798). ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus also questioned the automatic tendency of a [[market economy]] to produce full employment. He blamed unemployment upon the economy's tendency to limit its spending by saving too much, a theme that lay forgotten until [[John Maynard Keynes]] revived it in the 1930s.

While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income, [[David Ricardo]] (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of [[comparative advantage]], according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower ''relative'' cost of production, rather relying only on its own production.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, 1817. ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been termed a &quot;fundamental analytical explanation&quot; for [[gains from trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Findlay]], 2008. &quot;comparative advantage&quot;, ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition, 1st paragraph. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254&amp;edition=current&amp;q=comparative%20advantage&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Coming at the end of the Classical tradition, [[John Stuart Mill]] (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart (1848, 1871, 7th ed.). ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the &quot;real price of every thing&amp;nbsp;... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it&quot; as influenced by its scarcity. Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adam (1776). [http://www.bartleby.com/10/105.html/ The Wealth of Nations], Bk. 1, Ch. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the '[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]'. Classical economics focused on the tendency of markets to move to long-run equilibrium.

===Marxism===
{{Main|Marxian economics}}
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The Marxist school of economic thought comes from the work of German economist [[Karl Marx]].|alt=A man facing the viewer]]

Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics. It derives from the work of [[Karl Marx]]. The first volume of Marx's major work, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the [[labour theory of value]] and the [[theory of surplus value]] which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roemer&quot;&gt;• [[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). &quot;Marxian value analysis&quot;. ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, 383.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Ernest Mandel|Mandel, Ernest]] (1987). &quot;Marx, Karl Heinrich&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economicsv. 3, pp. 372, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.

===Neoclassical economics===
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}
A body of theory later termed &quot;neoclassical economics&quot; or &quot;[[Marginalist Revolution|marginalism]]&quot; formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term &quot;economics&quot; was popularized by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for 'economic science' and a substitute for the earlier &quot;[[political economy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallJevons&quot; /&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, Barry (1998). ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'', Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics systematized [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] inherited from classical economics in favor of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Antonietta (1987). &quot;marginalist economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favor of [[ordinal utility]], which hypothesizes merely behavior-based relations across persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.D. Collison Black (1987 [2008])). &quot;utility&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping [[decision making]]. An immediate example of this is the [[consumer theory]] of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hicks&quot;/&gt; In [[macroeconomics]] it is reflected in an early and lasting [[neoclassical synthesis]] with Keynesian macroeconomics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hicks|Hicks, J.R.]] (1937). &quot;Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics': A Suggested Interpretation&quot;, ''Econometrica'', 5(2), p [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9682%28193704%295%3A2%3C147%3AMKAT%22A%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage p. 147–159].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as ''orthodox economics'' whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern [[mainstream economics]] builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as [[econometrics]], [[game theory]], analysis of [[market failure]] and [[imperfect competition]], and the [[neoclassical model]] of [[economic growth]] for analyzing long-run variables affecting [[national income]].

===Keynesian economics===
{{Main|Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian economics|}}
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] (right), was a key theorist in economics.]]

Keynesian economics derives from [[John Maynard Keynes]], in particular his book ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936), which ushered in contemporary [[macroeconomics]] as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]] |publisher= Macmillan|year=1936 |location=London |isbn=1-57392-139-4 }}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 347. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low &quot;[[effective demand]]&quot; and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. Such terms as &quot;revolutionary&quot; have been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;• Tarshis, L. (1987). &quot;Keynesian Revolution&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 47–50.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Samuelson, Paul A., and William D. Nordhaus (2004). ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'', p. 5.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Blaug, Mark (2007). &quot;The Social Sciences: Economics&quot;, ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', v. 27, p. 346. Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesian economics has two successors. [[Post-Keynesian economics]] also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]] and the work of [[Joan Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Harcourt, G.C.(1987). &quot;Post-Keynesian Economics&quot;, ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New-Keynesian economics]] is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behavior but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.

===Chicago school of economics===
{{Main|Chicago school (economics)}}
The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to [[Milton Friedman]] and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. [[Ben Bernanke]], current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;fed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|accessdate=2008-02-26|date=2002-11-08|author=Ben Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the September 1970 issue of The New York Times Magazine, where he claims that the social responsibility of business should be &quot;to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits&amp;nbsp;... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton. &quot;The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits.&quot; The New York Times Magazine 13 Sep. 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other schools and approaches===
{{Main|Schools of economics}}
Other well-known schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practiced at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the [[Austrian School]], the [[Freiburg School]], the [[School of Lausanne]], [[post-Keynesian economics]] and the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]]. Contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] and [[West coast of the United States|Western]] coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago-school approach.

Within macroeconomics there is, in general order of their appearance in the literature; [[classical economics]], [[Keynesian economics]], the neoclassical synthesis, [[post-Keynesian economics]], [[monetarism]], [[new classical economics]], and [[supply-side economics]]. Alternative developments include [[ecological economics]], [[constitutional economics]], [[institutional economics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[dependency theory]], [[structuralist economics]], [[world systems theory]], [[econophysics]], [[feminist economics]] and [[biophysical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/10/23/23greenwire-new-school-of-thought-brings-energy-to-the-dis-63367.html?pagewanted=all New School of Thought Brings Energy to 'the Dismal Science'] [[New York Times]] Retrieved Oct-26-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===
&quot;[[The dismal science]]&quot; is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname &quot;the dismal science&quot; as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend [[Thomas Malthus|Thomas Robert Malthus]], who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with [[John Stuart Mill]] on [[slavery]], in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dismal&quot;/&gt;

Some economists, like [[John Stuart Mill]] or [[Léon Walras]], have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution. The former is in the field of &quot;applied economics&quot; while the latter belongs to &quot;social economics&quot; and is largely a matter of power and politics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Origin of Economic Ideas'', Guy Routh (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Wealth of Nations'', [[Adam Smith]] addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smith's day, these were referred to as [[Political faction|factions]], but are now more commonly called [[special interests]], a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright [[oligopolies]], [[monopolies]], [[trade unions]] and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;See Noam Chomsky (''Understanding Power''), [http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm#f1] on Smith's emphasis on class conflict in the Wealth of Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics per se, as a social science, is independent of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization, however, many [[policymaker]]s or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and [[rhetoric]] as vehicles to legitimize [[Political agenda|agendas]] and [[value systems]], and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;dismal science to get real&quot;&gt;Sara Ledwith and Antonella Ciancio, [http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-europe-economics-teaching-idUSBRE86207O20120703 Special Report: Crisis forces &quot;dismal science&quot; to get real], [[Reuters]] (July 3, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The close relation of economic theory and practice with [[politics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/rps/rps2006/rp2006-148.pdf Research Paper No. 2006/148 Ethics, Rhetoric and Politics of Post-conflict Reconstruction How Can the Concept of Social ContractHelp Us in Understanding How to Make Peace Work? Sirkku K. Hellsten, pg. 13]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan F.

Hahn |publisher=Stratapub.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals are currently focusing increased efforts on gauging the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Currently, there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in a recent survey of AEA economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.&lt;ref&gt;Whaples, Robert. &quot;The Policy Views of American Economic Association Members: The Results of a New Survey&quot;.

In ''Steady State Economics'' 1977, [[Herman Daly]] argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dieoff.org/page88.htm Steady-State Economics], by Herman Daly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of assumptions===
Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified assumptions, in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions. Examples of such assumptions include [[perfect information]], [[profit maximization]] and [[rational choice theory|rational choices]].&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Steven (1996). &quot;Abstraction and Unrealistic Assumptions in Economics&quot;, ''Journal of Economic Methodology'', 3(2), pp. 215–236.

&lt;/ref&gt; and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on [[oligopoly]] research, [[Paul Joskow]] pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use &quot;informal models&quot; based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were &quot;trotted out ''[[ex post]]''&quot;. He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behavior, was neglected.&lt;ref&gt;

In recent years, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of [[feminist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;England, Paula (1993). &quot;The Separative Self: Androcentric Bias in Neoclassical Assumptions&quot;, ''Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics'', University of Chicago Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–53.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a [[positive economics|positive]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics&lt;ref name=&quot;beyond&quot;&gt;Ferber, M.A. and Julie A. Nelson, &quot;''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later,&quot; in Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, eds., ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors ([[homo economicus]]); exogenous tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of unpaid work; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. [[Feminist economics]] developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. Feminists such as [[Marilyn Waring]] also argue that the discipline of economics ignores [[women's work|women's unpaid work]] and the value of [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn Waring]] (1988.)

Philip Mirowski observes that 
{{quote|
The imperatives of the orthodox research programme [of economic science] leave little room for maneuver and less room for originality.&amp;nbsp;... These mandates&amp;nbsp;... Appropriate as many mathematical techniques and metaphorical expressions from contemporary respectable science, primarily physics as possible.&amp;nbsp;... Preserve to the maximum extent possible the attendant nineteenth-century overtones of &quot;natural order&quot;&amp;nbsp;... Deny strenuously that neoclassical theory slavishly imitates physics.&amp;nbsp;... Above all, prevent all rival research programmes from encroaching&amp;nbsp;... by ridiculing all external attempts to appropriate twentieth century physics models.&amp;nbsp;... All theorizing is [in this way] held hostage to nineteenth-century concepts of energy.&lt;ref&gt;

In a series of peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and books published over a period of several decades, [[John McMurtry]]&lt;ref&gt;Please see partial list of publications, including peer-reviewed papers and books, on [[John McMurtry]]'s wikipedia page, as well as links to the text of several of his peer-reviewed papers and peer-reviewed secondary references analyzing and discussing his work.&lt;/ref&gt; has provided extensive criticism of what he terms the &quot;unexamined assumptions and implications [of economics], and their consequent cost to people's lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McMurtryCancerStage&quot;&gt;
[[John McMurtry]], The Cancer Stage of Capitalism. London, Pluto Books, 1999. The book is a scholarly examination and criticism of economics. The book is available for free download from several sites online, for example here [http://www.jaunimieciai.lt/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-cancer-stage-of-capitalism.pdf]. (In April 2012, the author stated he is working on an updated edition.)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, he writes 
{{quote|This is why we might conclude that economics ceased to be a science or an investigation once it presupposed an engineering physics model as its methodological given. It became instead the defining software of a machinal system with no place for life in its money-sequence operations. Like the received dogma of another epoch, its formulations decoupled from reality in a scholastic formalism, its priesthood would not acknowledge the right of any but trained believers to speak on issues designated by the subject, and its iron laws subsumed all that lived as material ready to be made productive by transformation into the system's service.&amp;nbsp;... Yet it would be a very great mistake to simply reject economics as a resource of analysis. It provides an articulated lexicon of exact referents, operations and principles of the global market mechanism which it presupposes as the natural order. And its resources are invaluable in coming to understand the system of rule which the global market now implements across the world in its restructuring operations. One has to expose and understand the principles the doctrine assumes in order to examine and unmask their implications for life-organization. One has to follow the assumptions its theoreticians take as given to see the trail of consequences for reality which obedience to this unseen metaphysic unleashes on the world. One has to connect across the logical lattice of the covert value system the defining axioms and co-ordinates it bears to see what it means for the planetary life-web as an integrated whole. One has, in short, to do what the economist avoids as the explosion of his own identity – open up its value structure to examination. This is what the study which follows [in this book] does&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=&quot;McMurtryCancerStage&quot;/&gt;

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Michael Perelman]] are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics. Taleb opposes most economic theorizing, which in his view suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's Theory of Forms, and calls for cancellation of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating.&lt;ref&gt;

For example, he says: 
{{quote|
The disconnect between what purports to be objective analysis [by classical political economists] and the underlying power relationships fascinates me. Like Moliere's bourgeois gentlemen, who was unaware that he was speaking prose, economists have developed a culture in which they communicate without any recognition of how much they have internalized the distorted perspective of a capitalist system. What is more surprising is how thoroughly the economists were able to propagate their flawed worldview throughout much of society. The economic worldview loses sight of essential elements of the world economists analyze. Once their simplistic world of economics spins out of control, economists' instinct is to explain away their deficiencies rather than finally coming to grips with the real world. In that sense, I feel that a critical study of economists and their economics becomes useful as a means of self-defense against the tyranny of markets.&amp;nbsp;... In their published books, the political economists at the time ignored the injustices associated with the enforcement of the feudal game laws, as well as the enormous economic damage done by the hunters. Instead, they described the economy as the result of voluntary transactions between willing buyers and sellers. Away from the public eye, these same economists applauded the displacement of rural masses, which was providing new bodies for the emerging proletariat. In this sense, capitalism was invented as I described in [the book] ''The Invention of Capitalism''. Capitalism was invented in another sense. The early economists described the emergence of capitalism as a voluntary system that benefited everybody. This falsification of history, which was central to their analysis, was a very creative invention&amp;nbsp;... In [the book] ''The Invisible Handcuffs'', I tried to show how economists tried to frame capitalism as a system of voluntary transactions, as I mentioned [above]. One can understand how the economists could have gotten away with this evasion of reality in a world when literacy was limited and communications [was] expensive. In a modern world, to be able to get away with such nonsense is an audacious act of genius. Economic theory also abstracts from virtually anything having to do with time.&lt;ref&gt;

'''History''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|''ἱστορία''}} - ''historia'', meaning &quot;inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation&quot;&lt;ref name=JosephJanda/&gt;) is an [[umbrella term]] that relates to past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization, and presentation of [[information]] about these events. The term includes [[Universe#History of the Universe|cosmic]], [[Geological history of the Earth|geologic]], and [[Organism#History of life|organic history]], but is often generically implied to mean [[History of the world|human history]]. Scholars who write about history are called [[historian]]s.

History can also refer to the [[academic discipline]] which uses a [[narrative]] to examine and analyse a sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Whatishistory/evans10.html|title= The Two Faces of E.H.

Historians sometimes debate the [[historiography|nature of history]] and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing &quot;perspective&quot; on the problems of the present.&lt;ref name=&quot;evans1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tosh1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|last=Tosh|first=John | publication-date=2006|publisher=Pearson Education Limited |isbn=1-4058-2351-8 | edition=4th}}p 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Knowing Teaching and Learning History, National and International Perspectives |editor= Peter N.

Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding [[King Arthur]]) are usually classified as [[cultural heritage]] or [[legend]]s, because they do not support the &quot;disinterested investigation&quot; required of the discipline of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Knowing Teaching and Learning History, National and International Perspectives |last= Seixas |first= Peter |editor= Peter N.

[[Herodotus]], a 5th century B.C. [[Greek historiography|Greek historian]] is considered within the Western tradition to be the &quot;father of history&quot;, and, along with his contemporary [[Thucydides]], helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history. Their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In the Eastern tradition, a state chronicle the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BCE although only 2nd century BCE texts survived.

Ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation. Often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a [[List of academic disciplines#History|major discipline]] in University studies.

==Etymology==
[[File:History-Dielman-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|''History'' by [[Frederick Dielman]] (1896)]]
A derivation from ''*weid-'' &quot;know&quot; or &quot;see&quot; is attested as &quot;the reconstructed etymon ''wid-tor'' [&quot;one who knows&quot;] (compare to English ''wit'') a suffixed zero-grade form of the [[proto-Indo-European root|PIE]] root ''*weid-'' 'see' and so is related to Greek ''eidénai'', to know&quot;.&lt;ref name=JosephJanda&gt;{{Cite book| last =Joseph | first =Brian (Ed.)| last2 =Janda | first2 =Richard (Ed.)| publication-date =30 December 2004| title =The Handbook of Historical Linguistics| publisher =Blackwell Publishing| page =163| isbn =978-1-4051-2747-9| year =2008| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etym&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=history |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek]] [[polytonic|ἱστορία]]&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|i(stori/a|ἱστορία}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''hístōr'') means &quot;inquiry&quot;,&quot;knowledge from inquiry&quot;, or  &quot;judge&quot;. It was in that sense that [[Aristotle]] used the word in his {{lang|grc|[[History of Animals|Περὶ Τὰ Ζῷα Ἱστορίαι]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot;&gt;Ferrater-Mora, José. ''Diccionario de Filosofia''. Barcelona: Editorial Ariel, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Perì Tà Zôa Ηistoríai'' &quot;Inquiries about Animals&quot;). The ancestor word {{lang|grc|ἵστωρ}} is attested early on in [[Homeric Hymns]], [[Heraclitus]], the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[ephebos|ephebes]]' oath, and in [[Boeotia|Boiotic]] inscriptions (in a legal sense, either &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;witness&quot;, or similar).

The word entered the [[English language]] in 1390 with the meaning of &quot;relation of incidents, story&quot;. In [[Middle English]], the meaning was &quot;story&quot; in general. The restriction to the meaning &quot;record of past events&quot; arises in the late 15th century. It was still in the Greek sense that [[Francis Bacon]] used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about &quot;[[Natural history|Natural History]]&quot;. For him, ''historia'' was &quot;the knowledge of objects determined by space and time&quot;, that sort of knowledge provided by [[memory]] (while [[science]] was provided by [[reason]], and [[poetry]] was provided by [[fantasy]]).

In an expression of the linguistic [[Synthetic language|synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy]], English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) now designates separate words for human history and [[storytelling]] in general. In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both &quot;history&quot; and &quot;story&quot;.

The adjective ''historical'' is attested from 1661, and ''historic'' from 1669.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]''. New York: The Century Co, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historian'' in the sense of a &quot;researcher of history&quot; is attested from 1531. In all [[European languages]], the substantive &quot;history&quot; is still used to mean both &quot;what happened with men&quot;, and &quot;the scholarly study of the happened&quot;, the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, &quot;History&quot;, or the word ''[[historiography]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferrater-Mora&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:The Historians' History of the World - Title Page.jpg|thumb|The title page to ''[[The Historians' History of the World]]'']]
Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past, and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. In the words of [[Benedetto Croce]], &quot;All history is contemporary history&quot;. History is facilitated by the formation of a 'true discourse of past' through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney&quot;&gt;Whitney, W. D. (1889). [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ The Century dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language]. New York: The Century Co. Page [http://books.google.com/books?id=wrACAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2842,M1 2842].&lt;/ref&gt; The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.

All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnet&quot;&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0], &quot;History&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past. Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the 'true past').

The study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the [[humanities]] and at other times as part of the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Gordon and James Gordon Irving, ''The History and Philosophy of Social Science''. Routledge 1991. Page 1. ISBN 0-415-05682-9&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both. Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, H. (1986). Dictionary of concepts in history. Reference sources for the social sciences and humanities, no. 3. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Page 416.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, French [[historian]] [[Fernand Braudel]] revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and [[geography]] in the study of global history.

Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an [[oral tradition]], and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. For the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Lemon (1995).The Discipline of History and the History of Thought. Routledge. Page 201. ISBN 0-415-12346-1&lt;/ref&gt; But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.

[[Archaeology]] is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects, which, once unearthed, contribute to the study of history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries. However, archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history; that is to say, archaeology does not &quot;fill the gaps&quot; within textual sources. Indeed, Historical Archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology, often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical [[Annapolis, Maryland]], USA has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment, despite the ideology of &quot;liberty&quot; inherent in written documents at this time.

There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, [[culture|culturally]], territorially, and thematically. These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant overlaps are often present, as in &quot;The International Women's Movement in an Age of Transition, 1830–1975.&quot; It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. The area called [[Big History]] resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. History has often been studied with some practical or [[theory|theoretical]] aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |year=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and prehistory==
{{Human history and prehistory|250}}
{{Further|Protohistory}}

The [[history of the world]] is the memory of the past [[experience]] of ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. By &quot;prehistory&quot;, historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[pre-Columbian]] America. Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1930&amp;dq=Jack+Goody+2007&amp;sig=g0N7ZF9nz_Uy8nrQTiGdsc0N3sI#PPA12,M1 The Theft of History]'' (from [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, British historian [[E. H. Carr]] wrote:
{{quote|The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p.108, ISBN 0-14-020652-3&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as [[Australian Aboriginals]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Māori]] in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization.

==Historiography==
{{Main|Historiography}}
Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of [[Historical method|methodology]] and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, &quot;medieval historiography during the 1960s&quot; means &quot;Works of medieval history written during the 1960s&quot;). Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the [[Philosophy of history]]. As a [[meta-level]] analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, [[Language interpretation|interpretations]], [[worldview]], use of [[evidence]], or method of presentation of other [[historian]]s. Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.

* Are there broad patterns and progress? Are there cycles? Is human history random and devoid of any meaning?

{{Main|Philosophy of history}}
Philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance, if any, of human history. Furthermore, it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development—that is, it asks if there is a design, purpose, directive principle, or finality in the processes of human history. Philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography, which is the study of history as an academic discipline, and thus concerns its methods and practices, and its development as a discipline over time. Nor should philosophy of history be confused with the [[history of philosophy]], which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.

&lt;div style=&quot;background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;&quot;&gt; Historical method basics &lt;/div&gt;

The following questions are used by historians in modern work.
# ''When was'' the source, written or unwritten, produced ([[Calendar date|date]])?
# Where was it produced ([[Internationalization and localization|localization]])?
# By whom was it produced ([[authorship]])?
# From what pre-existing material was it produced ([[wikt:analysis|analysis]])?
# In what original form was it produced ([[integrity]])?
# What is the evidential value of its contents ([[credibility]])?
The first four are known as [[higher criticism]]; the fifth, [[lower criticism]]; and, together, external criticism. ''The sixth and final inquiry'' about a source is called internal criticism.

The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 BC – ca.425 BC)&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=5|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the &quot;father of history&quot;. However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (ca. 460 BC – ca. 400 BC) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the [[History of the Peloponnesian War]]. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p5&quot;/&gt; In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings. Greek historians also viewed history as [[Historic recurrence|cyclical]], with events regularly recurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamberg-karlovsky-p6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. and Jeremy A. Sabloff |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |year=1979 |page=6|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval [[China]]. The groundwork for professional historiography in [[East Asia]] was established by the [[Han Dynasty]] court historian known as [[Sima Qian]] (145–90 BC), author of the ''[[Shiji]]'' ([[Records of the Grand Historian]]). For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of [[Chinese Historiography]]. Chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in China used his ''Shiji'' as the official format for [[Twenty-Four Histories|historical texts]], as well as for biographical literature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;graham-ch1&quot;/&gt;

In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized &quot;idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data.&quot; As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his &quot;new science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], ISBN 0-691-01754-9.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). &quot;Information in the Arab World&quot;, ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the &quot;father of historiography&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

In the West historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany. The 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany.

In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. Some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included [[Fernand Braudel]], [[E. H. Carr]], [[Fritz Fischer]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Bruce Trigger]], [[Marc Bloch]], [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Peter Gay]], [[Robert Fogel]], [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Lawrence Stone]]. Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. More recently, the field of [[digital history]] has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.

In opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], [[John Lukacs]], [[Donald Creighton]], [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] and [[Gerhard Ritter]] argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the [[imagination]], and hence contended that history should be understood as an art. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]] (cf. ''[[histoire des mentalités]]''). Intellectual historians such as [[Herbert Butterfield]], [[Ernst Nolte]] and [[George Mosse]] have argued for the significance of ideas in history. American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups. Another genre of [[social history]] to emerge in the post-WWII era was ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (History of Everyday Life). Scholars such as [[Martin Broszat]], [[Ian Kershaw]] and [[Detlev Peukert]] sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the [[Nazi]] period.

[[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]] such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Rodney Hilton]], [[Georges Lefebvre]], [[Eugene D. Genovese]], [[Isaac Deutscher]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Timothy Mason]], [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[Arno J. Mayer]] and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] have sought to validate [[Karl Marx]]'s theories by analyzing history from a Marxist perspective. In response to the Marxist interpretation of history, historians such as [[François Furet]], [[Richard Pipes]], [[J. C. D. Clark]], [[Roland Mousnier]], [[Henry Ashby Turner]] and [[Robert Conquest]] have offered anti-Marxist interpretations of history.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Feminism|Feminist]] historians such as [[Joan Wallach Scott]], [[Claudia Koonz]], [[Natalie Zemon Davis]], [[Sheila Rowbotham]], [[Gisela Bock]], [[Gerda Lerner]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], and [[Lynn Hunt]] have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past. In recent years, [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources. In his 1997 book ''In Defence of History'', [[Richard J. Evans]], a professor of modern history at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], defended the worth of history. Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]]'s 1994 book, ''The Killing of History''.

===Periods===
{{Main|Periodization}}
Historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time. Historians give these [[Periodization|periods of time]] names in order to allow &quot;organising ideas and classificatory generalisations&quot; to be used by historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwick-p169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of History |author=Marwick, Arthur|publisher=The Macmillian Press LTD |year=1970 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period. [[Centuries]] and [[decade]]s are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the [[Calendar era|dating system]] used. Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past. The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosh-p168-169&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pursuit of History|author=Tosh, John|publisher=Pearson Education Limited|year=2006 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical locations===
Particular [[geographical]] locations can form the basis of historical study, for example, [[continent]]s, [[countries]] and [[cities]]. Understanding why historic events took place is important. To do this, historians often turn to [[geography]]. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the [[geography of Egypt]] is essential. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.

====World====
{{Main|History of the world}}
World history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. It has led to highly controversial interpretations by [[Oswald Spengler]] and [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], among others. World history is especially important as a teaching field. It has increasingly entered the university curriculum in the U.S., in many cases replacing courses in Western Civilization, that had a focus on Europe and the U.S. World history adds extensive new material on Asia, Africa and Latin America.

====Regions====
* [[History of Africa]] begins with the first emergence of modern human beings on the continent, continuing into its modern present as a patchwork of diverse and politically developing nation states.
* [[History of the Americas]] is the collective history of North and South America, including Central America and the Caribbean.
** [[History of North America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's northern and western hemisphere.
** [[History of Central America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's western hemisphere.
** [[History of the Caribbean]] begins with the oldest evidence where 7,000-year-old remains have been found.
** [[History of South America]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation on the continent in the Earth's southern and western hemisphere.
* [[History of Antarctica]] emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe.
* [[History of Australia]] start with the documentation of the Makassar trading with Indigenous Australians on Australia's north coast.
* [[History of New Zealand]] dates back at least 700 years to when it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture centred on kinship links and land.
* [[History of the Pacific Islands]] covers the history of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.
* [[History of Eurasia]] is the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions: the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.
** [[History of Europe]] describes the passage of time from humans inhabiting the European continent to the present day.
** [[History of Asia]] can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.
*** [[History of East Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in East Asia.
*** [[History of the Middle East]] begins with the earliest civilizations in the region now known as the Middle East that were established around 3000 BC, in Mesopotamia (Iraq).
*** [[History of South Asia]] is the study of the past passed down from generation to generation in the Sub-Himalayan region.
*** [[History of Southeast Asia]] has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}

[[Military history]] concerns warfare, strategies, battles, weapons, and the psychology of combat.  The &quot;new military history&quot; since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.&lt;ref name=Pavkovic&gt;{{Cite book | last =Pavkovic

===History of religion===
{{Main|Religious history}}

The history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries, and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe. Leading journals include ''[[Church History (periodical)|Church History]]'', ''[[Catholic Historical Review]]'', and ''[[History of Religions (journal)|History of Religions]]''. Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Cochrane, &quot;What Is Catholic Historiography?&quot; ''Catholic Historical Review'' Vol. 61, No. 2 (April , 1975), pp. 169-190 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/25019673 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Every major country is covered,&lt;ref&gt;For example see Sofia Boesch Gajano and Tommaso Caliò, &quot;Italian religious historiography in the 1990s,&quot; ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies,'' Fall 1998, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 293-306&lt;/ref&gt; and most smaller ones as well.

===Social history===
{{Main|Social history}}
''Social history'', sometimes called the ''new social history,'' is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stearns, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Social History'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; In its &quot;golden age&quot; it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments. In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, &quot;Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations,&quot; ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with '''social history''' while [[political history]] came next with 1425 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html &quot;Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007 - listed by research interest&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The &quot;old&quot; social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were &quot;social&quot; in the sense of being outside the elite system. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, &quot;Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=0-582-48488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as &quot;history with the people put back in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Cultural history===
{{Main|Cultural history}}
Cultural history replaced [[social history]] as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of [[Art history|art in society]] as well is the study of images and human visual production [[Iconography|(iconography)]].&lt;ref&gt;The first World Dictionnary of Images: Laurent Gervereau (ed.), &quot;Dictionnaire mondial des images&quot;, Paris, Nouveau monde, 2006, 1120p, ISBN : 978-2-84736-185-8. (with 275 specialists from all continents, all specialities, all periods from Prehistory to nowadays) ; Laurent Gervereau, &quot;Images, une histoire mondiale&quot;, Paris, Nouveau monde, 2008, 272p., ISBN : 978-2-84736-362-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomatic history===
{{Main|Diplomatic history}}
[[Diplomatic history]], sometimes referred to as &quot;''Rankian History''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P. (1998). New perspectives on historical writing. University Park, Pa: [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; in honor of [[Leopold von Ranke]], focuses on [[politics]], politicians and other high rulers and views them as being the driving force of continuity and change in history. This type of ''political history'' is the study of the conduct of [[International relations#History|international relations]] between states or across state boundaries over time. This is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be.

===Economic history===
{{main|Economic history}}
Although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Whaples, &quot;Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study?,&quot; Historically Speaking (April 2010) v. 11#2 pp 17-20, with responses pp 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental history===
{{main|Environmental history}}
Environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Hughes, ''What is Environmental History'' (2006) [http://www.amazon.com/What-Environmental-History/dp/0745631886/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===World history===
{{main|World history}}
World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field.  It gained popularity in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie T. Embree and Carol Gluck, eds., ''Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching''  (M.E. Sharpe, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Japan&lt;ref&gt;Shigeru Akita, &quot;World History and the Emergence of Global History in Japan,&quot;''Chinese Studies in History,'' Spring 2010, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 84-96&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.

The World History Association publishes the ''Journal of World History'' every quarter since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.historycooperative.org/jwhindex.html JWH Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The H-World discussion list&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.h-net.org/~world/ H-World]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.

===People's history===
{{Main|People's history}}
A [[people's history]] is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the [[Populism|perspective of common people]]. A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], the [[oppression|oppressed]], the [[poverty|poor]], the [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]], and the otherwise forgotten people. This history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time, or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur.

===Historiometry===
{{Main|Historiometry }}
[[Historiometry]] is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts.

===Gender history===
{{Main|Gender history}}
[[Gender history]] is a sub-field of History and [[Gender studies]], which looks at the past from the perspective of [[gender]]. It is in many ways, an outgrowth of [[women's history]]. Despite its relatively short life, Gender History (and its forerunner Women's History) has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history. Since the 1960s, when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance, it has gone through a number of different phases, each with its own challenges and outcomes. Although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious, such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession, other influences are more subtle.

===Public history===
{{Main|Public history}}
[[Public history]] describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings. Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields. The term itself began to be used in the U.S. and Canada in the late 1970s, and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time. Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government.

==Historians==
{{Main|List of historians}}

Professional and amateur historians discover, collect, organize, and present information about past events. In [[list of historians|lists of historians]], historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized. Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included.

==The judgement of history==
Since the 20th century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the &quot;judgement of history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Curran2000p413&quot;&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA413&amp;lpg=PA413 pp.413-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of [[legal judgement]]s, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curran2000p415&quot;&gt;Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F. C. DeCoste, Bernard Schwartz (eds.) ''Holocaust's Ghost: Writings on Art, Politics, Law and Education'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=lLnBSq7YP0gC&amp;pg=PA415&amp;lpg=PA415 p.415]&lt;/ref&gt; A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of [[collective memory]].

==Pseudohistory==
{{Main|Pseudohistory}}

''[[Pseudohistory]]'' is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard [[Historical method|historiographical conventions]] in a way which undermines their conclusions.
Closely related to deceptive [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionsm]], works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory.

==Teaching history==
From the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority.  In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe. In the U.S. after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching [[world history]] or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Swansinger, &quot;Preparing Student Teachers for a World History Curriculum in New York,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' (November 2009), 43#1 pp 87-96&lt;/ref&gt;

At the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. Many view the field from both perspectives.

The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the [[Nouvelle histoire]] as disseminated after the 1960s by ''Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement'' and other journals for teachers. Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP).  Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians’ approaches as well as facts and dates. Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote &quot;active methods&quot; which would give pupils &quot;the immense happiness of discovery.&quot; Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Abby Waldman, &quot; The Politics of History Teaching in England and France during the 1980s,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal''  Issue 68, Autumn 2009 pp. 199-221  [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v068/68.waldman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias in school teaching===
In most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism, and give students the official line about national enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Nicholls, ed. ''School History Textbooks across Cultures: International Debates and Perspectives'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light. For example, in Japan, mention of the [[Nanking Massacre]] has been removed from textbooks and the entire World War II is given cursory treatment. Other countries have complained.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schneider, &quot;The Japanese History Textbook Controversy in East Asian Perspective,&quot; ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,'' May 2008, Vol. 617, pp 107-122&lt;/ref&gt; It was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid Marxist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Problems of Teaching Contemporary Russian History,&quot; ''Russian Studies in History,'' Winter 2004, Vol. 43 Issue 3, pp 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2008.00708.x?cookieSet=1 |title=Blackwell-Synergy.com |publisher=Blackwell-Synergy.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sociologist [[James Loewen]], in the United States the history of the [[American Civil War]] some places has been phrased to avoid giving offense to white Southerners&lt;ref&gt;James W. Loewen, ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]'', (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and blacks.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}{{qn|date=September 2012}}

Academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks, sometimes with success.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Teaching History in Schools: the Politics of Textbooks in India,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal,'' April 2009, Issue 67, pp 99-110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatyana Volodina, &quot;Teaching History in Russia After the Collapse of the USSR,&quot; ''History Teacher,'' February 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 2, pp 179-188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 21st-century Germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an &quot;almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone&quot; and reflects &quot;principles formulated by international organizations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.&quot;  The result is that &quot;German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simone Lässig and Karl Heinrich Pohl, &quot;History Textbooks and Historical Scholarship in Germany,&quot; ''History Workshop Journal'' Issue 67, Spring 2009 pp 128-9 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_workshop_journal/v067/67.lassig.html online at project MUSE]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education''' in its general sense is a form of [[learning]] in which [[knowledge]], [[skills]], and [[habit (psychology)|habits]] of a group of people are transferred from one generation to the next through teaching, training, research, or simply through [[autodidacticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word &quot;education&quot; is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' (&quot;A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing&quot;) from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' (&quot;I educate, I train&quot;) which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' (&quot;I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect&quot;) from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' (&quot;from, out of&quot;) and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]] (&quot;I lead, I conduct&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of government==
A right to education has been created and recognized by some jurisdictions: Since 1952, Article 2 of the first Protocol to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''[[Belgian linguistic case]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global level, the [[United Nations]]' [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] of 1966 guarantees this right under its Article 13.&lt;ref name=ICESCR-art13.1&gt;''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history various governments have made it illegal to educate children [[Private school|privately]] or at home. Various [[totalitarian regime]]s, for example, have mandated indoctrination through propaganda in the [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Communist_propaganda#Education|propaganda in education under various communist regimes]].

==Systems==
[[File:School children line Cochin Kerala India.jpg|thumb|School children line, in Kerala, [[India]]]]
Systems of schooling involve institutionalized teaching and learning in relation to a curriculum, which itself is established according to a predetermined purpose of the schools in the system. Schools systems are sometimes also based on religions, giving them different curricula.

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
[[File:Eden College, Durban Multiform.jpg|thumb|right|School children in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].]]
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive, and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university–or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml Education World: Fine Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschools===
{{Main|Preschool education}}
The term preschool refers to a school for children who are not old enough to attend kindergarten. It is a nursery school.

Preschool education is important because it can give a child the edge in a competitive world and education climate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} While children who do not receive the fundamentals during their preschool years will be taught the alphabet, counting, shapes and colors and designs when they begin their formal education they will be behind the children who already possess that [[knowledge]]. The true purpose behind kindergarten is &quot;to provide a child-centered, preschool curriculum for three to seven year old children that aimed at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary schools===
{{Main|Primary education}}
[[Image:Teaching Bucharest 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Primary school in open air. Teacher (priest) with class from the outskirts of [[Bucharest]], around 1842.]]
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first 5–7&amp;nbsp;years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six or eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of primary-age children are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools''. Primary schools in these countries are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, compulsory education spans over twelve years, out of which children receive elementary education for 8 years. Elementary schooling consists of five years of primary schooling and 3 years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on national curriculum framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary schools===
{{Main|Secondary education}}
[[File:Ashs-teacher-and-students.jpg|thumb|Students working with a teacher at Albany Senior High School, [[New Zealand]]]]
[[File:Samdach Euv High School.jpg|thumb|Students in a classroom at Samdach Euv High School, [[Cambodia]]]]
In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minor]]s, to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], &quot;post-secondary&quot;, or &quot;[[Higher education|higher]]&quot; education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]s, [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them, but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling. Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada and [[Australia]] primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]] or to train directly in a [[profession]].

The emergence of secondary education in the United States did not happen until 1910, caused by the rise in big businesses and technological advances in factories (for instance, the emergence of electrification), that required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[high school]]s were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved to be beneficial for both employers and employees, for the improvement in human capital caused employees to become more efficient, which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than employees with just primary educational attainment.

In Europe, grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves have an even longer history.

===Autodidacticism===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) is self-directed learning that is related to but different from [[informal learning]]. In a sense, autodidacticism is &quot;learning on your own&quot; or &quot;by yourself&quot;, and an autodidact is a self-teacher. Autodidacticism is a contemplative, absorbing process. Some autodidacts spend a great deal of time reviewing the resources of libraries and educational websites. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. While some may have been informed in a conventional manner in a particular field, they may choose to inform themselves in other, often unrelated areas. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director),and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Vocational===
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Indigenous===
{{Main|Indigenous education}}

[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to &quot;reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author=May, S. and Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–145|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchistic free schools===
{{Main|Anarchistic free school}}
An anarchistic free school (also anarchist free school and free school) is a decentralized network in which skills, information, and knowledge are shared without hierarchy or the institutional environment of formal schooling. Free school students may be adults, children, or both. This organisational structure is distinct from ones used by democratic free schools which permit children's individual initiatives and learning endeavors within the context of a school democracy, and from free education where 'traditional' schooling is made available to pupils without charge. The open structure of free schools is intended to encourage self-reliance, critical consciousness, and personal development. Free schools often operate outside the [[market economy]] in favor of a [[gift economy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nevertheless, the meaning of the &quot;free&quot; of free schools is not restricted to monetary cost, and can refer to an emphasis on free speech and student-centred education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
[[Alternative education]], also known as ''non-traditional education'' or ''educational alternative'', is a broad term that may be used to refer to all forms of education outside of [[traditional education]] (for all age groups and levels of education). This may include not only forms of education designed for students with special needs (ranging from teenage pregnancy to intellectual disability), but also forms of education designed for a general audience and employing alternative educational philosophies and methods.

Alternatives of the latter type are often the result of [[education reform]] and are rooted in various [[Philosophy of education|philosophies]] that are commonly fundamentally different from those of traditional [[compulsory education]]. While some have strong [[politics|political]], [[Scholarly method|scholarly]], or [[philosophy|philosophical]] orientations, others are more informal associations of teachers and [[student]]s dissatisfied with certain aspects of [[traditional education]]. These alternatives, which include [[charter school]]s, [[alternative school]]s, [[independent school]]s, [[homeschooling]] and [[autodidacticism]] vary, but often emphasize the value of small class size, close relationships between students and teachers, and a [[sense of community]].

Alternative education may also allow for independent learning and engaging class activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Warmaudit31%205.pdf | title = The Natural Learning Project| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Journal of Experiential Learning and Simulation | volume = 1 | pages = 5–12 | year = 1979 | publisher = Elseiver North-Holland, Inc. 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were often educated by physicians or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  Special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities in its early years, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Credo Reference&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education through recreation===
The concept of education through recreation was first applied to childhood development in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–145 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=http://www.archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educationalist Lawrence [[L.P. Jacks]], who was also an early proponent of lifelong learning, best described the modern concept of education through recreation in the following quotation &quot;A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well.&quot;(Jacks, 1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullah 2012 165–170&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative.| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–170 | volume =5 |PMID=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullah 2012 165–170&quot;/&gt;

==Systems of higher education==
{{Main|Higher education}}
[[Image:ClareCollegeAndKingsChapel.jpg|right|thumb|The [[University of Cambridge]] is an institute of higher learning.]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities are the main institutions that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt of [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education generally involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

===University systems===
[[File:FBE CTU lecture.jpg|thumb|Lecture at the Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, [[Czech Technical University in Prague|CTU]] in Prague.]]
University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the ''undergraduate'' level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the ''[[graduate student|graduate]]'' (or ''postgraduate'') level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Universities are generally composed of several colleges. In the United States, universities can be private and independent, like [[Yale University]], they can be public and State governed, like the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]], or they can be independent but State funded, like the [[University of Virginia]].

Higher education in particular is currently undergoing a transition towards [[open education]], [[elearning]] alone is currently growing at 14 times the rate of traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knewton.com/digital-education/ |title=The State of Digital Education Infographic - #edtech #edutech #edu11 |publisher=Knewton.com |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open education is fast growing to become the dominant form of education, for many reasons such as its efficiency and results compared to traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lohr |first=Steve |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/study-finds-that-online-education-beats-the-classroom/ |title=Study Finds That Online Education Beats the Classroom&amp;nbsp;— NYTimes.com |work=The New York Times |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost of education has been an issue throughout history, and a major political issue in most countries today. Open education is generally significantly cheaper than traditional campus based learning and in many cases even free. Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form [[edX]] Other universities offering open education are Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington, Caltech. It has been called the biggest change in the way we learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U.

The conventional merit system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities. Although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Currently many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal &quot;[[Academic capital|academic value]]&quot; to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree? &amp;#124; Jobs on GOOD |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

There has been a culture forming around distance learning for people who are looking to enjoy the shared social aspects that many people value in traditional on campus education that is not often directly offered from open education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Examples of this are people in open education forming [[study groups]], [[Meetup (website)|meetups]] and movements such as [[UnCollege]].

===Liberal arts colleges===
[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|Saint Anselm College, a traditional [[New England]] liberal arts college.]]
A [[liberal arts]] institution can be defined as a &quot;[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: Encyclopædia Britannica Concise| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as the liberal arts college began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| publisher = The Journal of Higher Education | year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term is more commonly associated with Universities in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Technology==
{{Main|Educational technology}}

One of the most substantial uses in education is the use of technology. Also technology is an increasingly influential factor in education. Computers and mobile phones are used in developed countries both to complement established education practices and develop new ways of learning such as [[online education]] (a type of [[distance education]]). This gives students the opportunity to choose what they are interested in learning. The proliferation of computers also means the increase of programming and blogging. Technology offers powerful learning tools that demand new skills and understandings of students, including [[Multimedia learning|Multimedia]], and provides new ways to engage students, such as [[Virtual learning environment]]s.
One such tool are [[Virtual manipulatives for mathematics|virtual manipulatives]], which are an &quot;interactive, Web-based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge&quot; (Moyer, Bolyard, &amp; Spikell, 2002). In short, virtual manipulatives are dynamic visual/pictorial replicas of physical mathematical manipulatives, which have long been used to demonstrate and teach various mathematical concepts. Virtual manipulatives can be easily accessed on the Internet as stand-alone applets, allowing for easy access and use in a variety of educational settings. Emerging research into the effectiveness of virtual manipulatives as a teaching tool have yielded promising results, suggesting comparable, and in many cases superior overall concept-teaching effectiveness compared to standard teaching methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Technology is being used more not only in administrative duties in education but also in the instruction of students. The use of technologies such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[interactive whiteboard]] is capturing the attention of students in the classroom. Technology is also being used in the assessment of students. One example is the [[Audience Response System]] (ARS), which allows immediate feedback tests and classroom discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tremblay | first = Eric|title = (2010) Educating the Mobile Generation&amp;nbsp;– using personal cell phones as audience response systems in post-secondary science teaching.

[[File:Students taking computerized exam.jpg|thumb|American students in 2001, in a computer fundamentals class taking a computer-based test]]
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a &quot;diverse set of tools and resources used to communicate, create, disseminate, store, and manage information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Blurton | first = Craig|title = New Directions of ICT-Use in Education| url=http://www.unesco.org/education/educprog/lwf/dl/edict.pdf |accessdate = 2007-02-06|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies include computers, the Internet, broadcasting technologies (radio and television), and telephony. There is increasing interest in how computers and the Internet can improve education at all levels, in both formal and non-formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;[[b:ICT in Education|ICT in Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Older ICT technologies, such as radio and television, have for over forty years been used for open and distance learning, although print remains the cheapest, most accessible and therefore most dominant delivery mechanism in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Potashnik, M. and Capper, J. | title = Distance Education:Growth and Diversity | url=http://www.worldbank.org/fandd/english/pdfs/0398/0110398.pdf| accessdate = 2007-02-06|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to classroom application and growth of e-learning opportunities for knowledge attainment, educators involved in student affairs programming have recognized the increasing importance of computer usage with data generation for and about students. Motivation and retention counselors, along with faculty and administrators, can impact the potential academic success of students by provision of technology based experiences in the University setting.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard (1989) Student Affairs-The Future.Journal of College Student Development, v30 n1 p&amp;nbsp;86–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of computers and the Internet is in its infancy in developing countries, if these are used at all, due to limited infrastructure and the attendant high costs of access. Usually, various technologies are used in combination rather than as the sole delivery mechanism. For example, the Kothmale Community Radio Internet uses both radio broadcasts and computer and Internet technologies to facilitate the sharing of information and provide educational opportunities in a rural community in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Taghioff | first = Daniel | title = Seeds of Consensus—The Potential Role for Information and Communication Technologies in Development. |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~daniel.taghioff/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031012140402/http://www.btinternet.com/~daniel.taghioff/index.html |archivedate=12 October 2003 | accessdate = 2003-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open University of the United Kingdom (UKOU), established in 1969 as the first educational institution in the world wholly dedicated to open and distance learning, still relies heavily on print-based materials supplemented by radio, television and, in recent years, online programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk Open University of the United Kingdom] Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Indira Gandhi National Open University in India combines the use of print, recorded audio and video, broadcast radio and television, and audio conferencing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignou.ac.in Indira Gandhi National Open University] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;computer-assisted learning&quot; (CAL) has been increasingly used to describe the use of technology in teaching. Classrooms of the 21st century contain interactive white boards, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[portable media player|mp3 players]], laptops, etc.  [[Wiki]] sites are another tool teachers can implement into CAL curricula for students to understand communication and collaboration efforts of group work through electronic means.{{Citation needed|reason='can implement' sounds vague and nearly WP:OR|date=February 2012}} Teachers are encouraged to embed these technological devices and services in the curriculum in order to enhance students learning and meet the needs of various types of learners.

==Adult==
{{Main|Adult education}}
Adult learning, or adult education, is the practice of [[training]] and developing skills in adults. It is also sometimes referred to as [[andragogy]] (the art and science of helping adults learn).Adult education has become common in many countries. It takes on many forms, ranging from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning and [[e-learning]]. A number of career specific courses such as [[veterinary]] assisting, medical billing and coding, [[real estate license]], [[bookkeeping]] and many more are now available to students through the [[Internet]].

With the boom of information from availability of knowledge through means of internet and other modern low cost information exchange mechanisms people are beginning to take an attitude of [[Lifelong learning]]. To make knowledge and [[self improvement]] a lifelong focus as opposed to the more traditional view that knowledge and in particular value creating trade skills are to be learned just exclusively in youth.

==Learning modalities==
[[File:Distributed Intelligent Systems Department laboratory.jpg|thumb|Students in laboratory, [[Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University]].]]
There has been work on learning styles over the last two decades. Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified individual talents or aptitudes in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. Based on the works of [[Jung]], the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

It is currently fashionable to divide education into different learning &quot;modes&quot;. The learning modalities&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt; are probably the most common:

* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Although it is claimed that, depending on their preferred learning modality, different teaching techniques have different levels of effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser,&lt;/ref&gt; recent research has argued &quot;there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A consequence of this theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C005704/content_hwl_learningmodalities.php3 |title=Learning modality description from the Learning Curve website |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org | accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that [[learning styles]] such as VAK are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;titleGuy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dystalk.com/talks/49-whats-the-point-of-school |title=Guy Claxton speaking on What's The Point of School?|publisher=dystalk.com |accessdate=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Learner%20Responsibility.pdf | title = Learner Responsibility in Management Education, or Ventures into Forbidden Research (with Comments) | author = J.

==Instruction==
[[File:Diego Suarez Antsiranana urban public primary school (EPP) Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Teacher in a classroom in [[Madagascar]]]]
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Winters| first =Marcus| title =Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators| publisher =Rowman &amp; Littlefield| page =160| isbn =978-1-4422-1077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WRS&quot;&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top]. mckinsey.com.

==Theory==

[[Education theory]] can refer to either a normative or a descriptive theory of education. In the first case, a theory means a postulation about what ought to be.

[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb| [[Nalanda]] ancient center for higher learning.]]
[[Image:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]]'s academy, [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]].]]

The history of education according to Dieter Lenzen, president of the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] 1994, &quot;began either millions of years ago or at the end of 1770&quot;. Education as a science cannot be separated from the educational traditions that existed before. Adults trained the young of their society in the knowledge and skills they would need to master and eventually pass on. The evolution of culture, and human beings as a species depended on this practice of transmitting knowledge. In pre-literate societies this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling continued from one generation to the next. Oral language developed into written symbols and letters. The depth and breadth of knowledge that could be preserved and passed soon increased exponentially. When cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond the basic skills of communicating, trading, gathering food, religious practices, etc., formal education, and schooling, eventually followed. Schooling in this sense was already in place in Egypt between 3000 and 500BC.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The first large established university is thought to be [[Nalanda]] established in 427 A.D in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleindia.com/life/7825-nalanda-the-world%E2%80%99s-first-university.html |title=Nalanda The World's First University |publisher=Little India |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=October 2012}}  At its peak, the university attracted scholars and students from as far away as Tibet, China, Greece, and Persia. The first university establishments in the western world are thought to be [[University of Bologna]] (founded in 1088) and later [[Oxford university]] (founded around 1096).

[[File:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction of the [[University of Bologna]], Italy, founded in 1088.]]
[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Matteo Ricci (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607.]]

In the West, [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] arose in the 6th century BC. [[Plato]] was the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] Greek [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and writer of philosophical dialogues who founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]] which was the first institution of higher learning in the [[Western world]]. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, [[Socrates]], prior to his unjust execution that &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;, Plato and his student, the [[political science|political scientist]] [[Aristotle]], helped lay the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] and science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Br&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt was founded in 330BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the [[Western World]]. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician [[Euclid]] and anatomist [[Herophilus]]; constructed the great [[Library of Alexandria]]; and translated the [[Hebrew]] Bible into Greek (called the [[Septuagint]] for it was the work of 70 translators). Greek civilization was subsumed within the [[Roman Empire]]. While the Roman Empire and its new Christian religion survived in an increasingly Hellenised form in the [[Byzantine Empire]] centered at Constantinople in the East, Western civilization suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in AD 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, [[Confucius]] (551-479), of the [[State of Lu]], was China's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan and Vietnam. He gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in the East into the modern era.

In Western Europe after the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] emerged as the unifying force. Initially the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe, the church established [[Cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Bologne]] is considered the oldest continually operating university.

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European [[Age of Empires]] saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilisations&amp;nbsp;— as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and the West, translating Western works like [[Euclids Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for Western audiences.  [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in the West.

===Modern times===
Nowadays some kind of education is compulsory to all people in most countries. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
[[Image:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
As an academic field, philosophy of education is a &quot;the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;... its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 0-8133-8429-X|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline.&quot;&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 0-02-865594-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive, and/or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Criticism===
[[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]] said, &quot;Modern education means handing down the customs of the minority, and rooting out the customs of the majority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = G.

===Purpose of schools===
{{Main|Education theory#Normative theories of education}}
Individuals purposes for pursuing education can vary. However in early age the focus is generally around developing basic [[Interpersonal communication]] and [[literacy]] skills in order to further ability to learn more complex skills and subjects. After acquiring these basic abilities education is commonly focused towards individuals gaining necessary knowledge and skills to improve ability to create value and a [[livelihood]] for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/oochart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Satisfying personal curiosities (Education for the sake of itself) and desire for [[Personal development]], to &quot;better oneself&quot; without career based reasons for doing so are also common reasons why people pursue education and use schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reed.edu/apply/news_and_articles/knowledge.html |title=Reed College &amp;#124; Reed College Admission Office |publisher=Reed.edu |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Image:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|left|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased [[high school]] [[graduation]] rates of students from [[low income]] families.&lt;ref name=finn&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Finn, J.

[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms &quot;educational psychology&quot; and &quot;school psychology&quot; are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

==Sociology==
{{Main|Sociology of education}}
[[File:Primary Laos2.jpg|thumb|right|School children in [[Laos]]]]
The [[sociology of education]] is the study of how social institutions and forces affect educational processes and outcomes, and vice versa. By many, education is understood to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater equality and acquiring wealth and status for all (Sargent 1994). Learners may be motivated by aspirations for progress and betterment. Learners can also be motivated by their interest in the subject area or specific skill they are trying to learn. In fact, learner-responsibility education models are driven by the interest of the learner in the topic to be studied.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Education is perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potentialities.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, K. (1999). [http://web.archive.org/web/20020214072003/http://www.aspa.asn.au/papers/eqfinalc.PDF The Purposes of Education], Queensland State Education&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of education can be to develop every individual to their full potential. The understanding of the goals and means of educational [[socialization]] processes differs according to the [[sociological paradigm]] used.

==Developing countries==
[[Image:Education index UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|thumb|300px|left|World map indicating [[Education Index]] (according to 2007/2008 [[Human Development Report]])]]

===Development goals and issues===
[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to receiving more funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en news room/latest news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_AEW_launch_en]. Transparency.org (23 February 2010). Retrieved on 2011-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the recurrent costs involved. There is economic pressure from those parents who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;de Grauwe, A. 2009. ''Without capacity, there is no development''. Paris: UNESCO-IIPE [http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;{{Clarify|date=October 2012}}
* they should embrace an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;{{clarify|&quot;one step at a time?&quot; What are they trying to say here?|date=October 2012}}
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development, while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. There are charities dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials, for example, the [[One Laptop per Child]] project.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an &quot;[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]&quot; to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabuur.com/ nabuur.com]&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationalization (Globalization and Education)==
Education is becoming increasingly international. The most represented case is the spread of mass schooling. Mass schooling has implanted the fundamental concepts that everyone has a right to be educated regardless of his/her cultural background and gender differences. The system has also promoted the global rules and norms of how the school should operate and what is education.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, David P., and Gerald K. LeTendre. &quot;World Culture and the Future of Schooling.&quot; The Globalization Reader. By Frank J. Lechner and John Boli. 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. 245-46. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Though the system can have variations in local, regional, and country level, the similarities&amp;nbsp;— in systems or even in ideas&amp;nbsp;— that schools share also enable the exchange among students at all levels which are also playing an increasingly important role in globalization process. In Europe, for example, the Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; stimulates exchanges across European universities. Also, the [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. Some scholars argue that, regardless of whether one system is considered better or worse than another, experiencing a different way of education can often be considered to be the most important, enriching element of an international learning experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Dubois, H. F. W., Padovano, G., &amp; Stew, G. |year=2006|title= Improving international nurse training: an American–Italian case study|journal=International Nursing Review|volume= 53|issue=2|pages=110–116|pmid=16650029|doi=10.1111/j.1466-7657.2006.00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[global campus]] online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes. This facilitates the globalization of education.

{{War}}'''War''' is an organised and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by [[State (polity)|states]] and/or [[non-state actors]]. It is characterised by extreme [[violence]], [[Society|social]] disruption, and economic destruction.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of [[political violence]] or [[interventionism (politics)|intervention]].&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as '''warfare'''. An absence of war is usually called [[peace]].

In 2003, Nobel Laureate [[Richard E. Smalley]] identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smalley Institute Grand Challenges |first=Richard E. |last=Smalley |publisher=[[Rice University]] |year=2008 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |url=http://cnst.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1832 [[treatise]] ''[[On War]]'', Prussian military general and theoretician [[Carl von Clausewitz]] defined war as follows: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Clausewitz|first1= Carl von|authorlink1= Carl Von Clausewitz|editor1-first= Michael|editor1-last= Howard|editor1-link=Peter Paret|editor2-first= Peter|editor2-last= Paret |title= On War|trans_title= Vom Krieg |edition= Indexed |year= 1984 |origyear= 1832|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= New Jersey |isbn= 978-0-691-01854-6|page= 75}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by [[John Keegan]] in his ''History of Warfare'', war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John, (1901) ''A History of Warfare'', (Pimlico)&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Societies at Peace (Howell and Willis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ever changing technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the one end lies the [[endemic warfare]] of the [[Paleolithic]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with its stones and clubs, and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons. Found at the other end of this continuum is [[nuclear warfare]], along with the recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of the complete [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].

The largest still ongoing conflict, in terms of cumulative number of deaths since start, is the [[Second Congo War]], with 3–5 million deaths since 1998, nearly invisible in non-African media.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil Hawkins, [http://books.google.se/books?id=C98wjmRllAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Virgil+Hawkins+%E2%80%9DStealth+conflicts&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YrIDUZW9MKfA0QX_wYGgBQ&amp;redir_esc=y  Stealth Conflicts: How the World's Worst Violence Is Ignored], Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the largest ongoing conflict in terms of deaths is the [[Mexican Drug War]] and the [[Syrian civil war]].{{cn|date=February 2013}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]].]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (c.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre''; the [[Old French|Old North French]] ''werre''; the [[Franks|Frankish]] ''werra''; and the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''werso''. The denotation of ''war'' derives from the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'': “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited derivation is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''barbaros'', the [[Old Persian]] ''varhara'', and the Sanskrit ''varvar'' and ''barbara''. In German, the equivalent is ''Krieg''; the equivalent Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Italian words for &quot;war&quot; is ''guerra'', derived from the Germanic ''werra'' (“fight”, “tumult”).&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Lengua Española'', 21&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; edición (1992) p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for &quot;war&quot;, to avoid using the [[Latin]] ''bellum'', because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word ''bello'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

==History of warfare==
{{Main|Military history}}
[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|300px|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, Archeologist)]]
Before the dawn of civilization, war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a [[Nubia]]n cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;&gt;Keeley: ''War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage''&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, &quot;One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W. Henderson|title=Understanding International Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AwMovLqKw2oC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=9 February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9764-9|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says that approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]

Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were perpetrated by primitive societies. A finding that has been supported by more recent research looking at violence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. The Bioarchaeology of Violence. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the massacre by pre-state societies can be exhibited by the [[Dogrib people|Dogrib]] tribes of the subarctic in North America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing 4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt; This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never recovered. Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate societies. The protection provided by defensive structures could not justify the valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote that &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [ie, after the coming of the Europeans]'. At [[Crow Creek massacre|Crow Creek]], South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a [[mass grave]] of 'more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca.

It is problematic however to suggest that people in past societies are any more violent than people today. Martin and colleagues in their recent book have pulled together some of the foremost researchers studying violence in the past to show that though there may be events like massacres in the past, like today the use and manifestation of warfare varies greatly both within and between societies.

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

Shortly after [[World War II]], as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;EinsteinWWIV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue, and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even advocated for the proclamation of another world war.&lt;ref&gt;NPR: [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5593631 Has World War III Begun?] July 31, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if &quot;half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html |date= 20 September 1976 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's &quot;Peace and Conflict&quot; study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J.

==Nine largest wars (by death toll)==
{{Main|List of wars by death toll}}
Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are of course the two World Wars, then followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all other war-death-tolls by a factor of two. This may be due to significant recent advances in weapons technologies, as well as recent increases in the overall human population.

==Types of warfare==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
War, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within the broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. [[War Studies]] by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish Civil War]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
In general, modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|National defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.

[[Conventional warfare]] is an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.

The opposite of conventional warfare, [[unconventional warfare]], is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.

[[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.

Civil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.

[[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric conflicts often result in [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.

Intentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called [[chemical warfare]]. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]], are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.

===Warfare environment===
The environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops' mobility and limitations.

===Behaviour and conduct in war===
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. ''New Glory: Expanding America's Global Supremacy'', 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in [[genocide]], [[war rape]] and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in World War I by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert. 1984. ''The Evolution of Cooperation.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of non-aggression, also from World War I, are detailed in &quot;[[Good-Bye to All That]].&quot; These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of World War I was the [[Christmas truce]].

The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden in World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=James|title=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On soldiers===
Soldiers subject to combat in war often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest that most soldiers resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving soldiers will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.|''14–18: Understanding the Great War'', Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

Additionally, it has been estimated that anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt;

Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the [[American Civil War]], including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maris Vinovskis|title=Toward a Social History of the American Civil War: Exploratory Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9D4TAwc93VoC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=28 September 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39559-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers. [[United States military casualties of war]] since 1775 have totaled over two million.

During [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s retreat from Moscow, more French soldiers died of [[typhus]] than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus]. Joseph M. Conlon.&lt;/ref&gt; Felix Markham thinks that 450,000 crossed the [[Neman River|Neman]] on 25 June 1812, of whom less than 40,000 recrossed in anything like a recognizable military formation.&lt;ref&gt;See a large copy of the chart here: http://www.adept-plm.com/Newsletter/NapoleonsMarch.htm, but discussed at length in Edward Tufte, ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information'' (London: Graphics Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; More soldiers were killed from 1500–1914 by typhus than from all military action during that time combined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if it were not for the modern medical advances there would be thousands of more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Royal Navy]] reported that it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were 'missing'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Turberville (2006). ''Johnson's England: An Account of the Life &amp; Manners of His Age''. ISBN READ BOOKS. p.53. ISBN 1-4067-2726-1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 378,000 people died due to war each year between 1985 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Obermeyer Z, Murray CJ, Gakidou E |title=Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1482–6 |year=2008 |month=June |pmid=18566045 |pmc=2440905 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a137 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}

Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, for example, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics].

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the [[American Civil War]]. In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (High government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the [[Great Depression]]) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====World War II====
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the [[Second World War]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html &quot;World War II&quot;] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P.

By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pilisuk|author2=Jennifer Achord Rountree|title=Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r9kNZrmG0E8C&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99435-8|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors ending a war==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}

{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war, usually depend on the [[facts on the ground]]. Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a [[stalemate]], they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the [[antebellum period|antebellum]] territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a [[treaty]], such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, which ended the [[First World War]].

A warring party that [[surrender (military)|surrenders]] or [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulates]] may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An [[unconditional surrender]] is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the [[Empire of Japan]] gave an unconditional surrender to the [[Allies of World War II]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] (see [[Surrender of Japan]]), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through [[deception]] or bluffing.

Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Carthage]] and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.

Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side. A raid for the purposes of [[looting]] may be completed with the successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Some hostilities, such as [[insurgency]] or civil war, may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease active military engagement but still threaten each other. A good example is the [[Chinese Civil War]] which was essentially over by 1950, but in the second half of the 20th Century the People's Republic of China began fighting to isolate the [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as [[Taiwan]]) diplomatically, and still sporadically threatens the island with an invasion. For this reason, some historians consider the war not ended but continuing.

==Efforts to stop wars==
[[File:1917 - Execution à Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|Execution at Verdun at the time of the [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] of 1917, when parts of the French Army refused to conduct further offensive operations.]]
Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against international terrorism that caused the [[September 11 attacks]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, work on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist significant worldwide [[opposition to the Iraq War]]. Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and perceived illegitimacy. 

The [[Mexican Drug War]], with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many have died in Mexico's drug war? |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologises to drug war victims |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments also use the method of [[disarmament]] to stop and prevent the cost of war.

==Theories for motivation==
There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Jack S.|year=1989|title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence|journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War|volume=I|page=295|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|editor1-first=Philip E.|editor1-last=Tetlock|editor2-first=Jo L.|editor2-last=Husbands|editor3-first=Robert|editor3-last=Jervis|editor4-first=Paul C.|editor4-last=Stern|editor5-first=Charles|editor5-last=Tilly|accessdate=4 May 2012|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome's leaders may have wished to make war with [[Carthage]] for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.

An interpretation of the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between [[Cain and Abel]] in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economics, B) Power, and C) Religion.&lt;ref name = &quot;MidrashQuote&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Tatars essentially sought booty, especially [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]].]]
In ''Why Nations Go to War'', by [[John G. Stoessinger]], the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on [[Fundamental attribution error|misperceptions of the enemy's intentions]].

As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593&lt;/ref&gt; The one constant factor is war’s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.

===Psychoanalytic psychology===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;meerloo&quot;&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p.134, Progressive Press, ISBN 978-1-61577-376-3
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought that war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. &quot;The Origin of Great Wars.&quot; ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population density and political organization and competition over resources. The other school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

This school argues that since organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = &quot;ApesWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}} Scholarly comparisons between human and ant wars
&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior. Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Crofoot, Margaret C. and Richard W. Wrangham, 2010 &quot;Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified Theory&quot; in Kappeler, Thomas M &amp; Joan B Silk (eds) ''Mind the Gap – tracing the origins of human universals''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and large-scale state formations.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;

One line of evidence for violent conflict among the ancestors of humans is [[sexual dimorphism]]. In species that have high levels of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our nearest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewin and Robert Foley. 2004 Principles of human evolution, 2nd ed.p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; The strength difference is greater for upper-body strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger, faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important factor in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and [[preemptive war]]s were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (&quot;[[honor]]&quot;). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the [[Chewong language|Chewong]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Crofoot and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.&lt;ref name=HumanPrimateAggression&gt;&quot;Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals&quot; By Peter M.

War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike.

===Marxist ===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[economic market|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and [[youth bulge]] theories.

====Malthusian ====
[[File:US soldiers in Kismayo, 1993.JPEG|thumb|US Army soldiers in [[Somalia]], 1993]]
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the [[Developed country|developed world]], where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where [[birth control]] has dramatically slowed the increase in population.

====Youth bulge====
[[File:Median age.png|thumb|300px|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent for South and Southeast Asia and Central America.]]
[[Youth bulge]] theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts – as graphically represented as a &quot;youth bulge&quot; in a [[population pyramid]] – with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.

While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, 'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of [[division of labour]].

Contributors to the development of [[youth bulge]] theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,&lt;ref&gt;Bouthoul, Gaston: &quot;L`infanticide différé&quot; (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sociologist [[Jack Goldstone|Jack A.

Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has modified his [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:

{{quote|I don't think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.

During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don't think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology.&lt;ref&gt;‘So, are civilizations at war?’, Interview with Samuel P. Huntington by Michael Steinberger, The Observer, Sunday October 21, 2001 [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/islam/story/0,,577982,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General [[John L. Helgerson]] referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends&quot;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palestinian militant with rifle.png|thumb|Palestinian militant with rifle, 2009]]
According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.

A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a [[sub-replacement fertility]] rate leading to [[population decline]].

Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4–8 children per mother implies 2–4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many &quot;angry young men&quot; find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are

# Demographically superfluous,
# Might be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and
# Often have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. ''See: [[Hypergamy]], [[Waithood]]''.

The combination of these [[stress (biological)|stress]] factors according to Heinsohn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/DefenceTraining.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:12 |title=Heinsohn, G.(2006): &quot;Demography and War.&quot; |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually heads for one of six different exits:
[[File:Detenciones Michoacán.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican soldiers detain [[Mexican Drug War|cartel]] suspects in Michoacán, 2007]]
# Emigration (&quot;non-violent [[colonization]]&quot;)
# Violent Crime
# Rebellion or [[putsch]]
# Civil war and/or revolution
# [[Genocide]] (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)
# [[Conquest (military)|Conquest]] (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).

Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism and today's &quot;Islamist&quot; civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005): &quot;Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century.&quot; [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:15]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Gaza Strip]] now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence, especially if compared to [[Lebanon]] which is geographically close, yet remarkably more peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Among prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of economic depression hitting the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, Comparative Studies in Society and

While the implications of population growth have been known since the completion of the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html |title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) – April 1974 |publisher=Population-security.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither the U.S. nor the WHO have implemented the recommended measures to control population growth to avert the terrorist threat.

===Rationalist===
Rationalist theories of war assume that both sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since [[Carl von Clausewitz]], that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.
Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, [[information asymmetry]] with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. 1995. &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War.&quot; International Organization 49, 3: 379–414. [http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/fearon-io1995v49n3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.

A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as [[Geoffrey Blainey]], is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.

Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the bargaining [[failure]] by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that [[Hermann Göring]] only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

The American decision to enter the [[Vietnam War]] was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]].

Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2002. &quot;Bargaining Theory and International Conflict.&quot; ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 5: 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.

Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship. Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.

Rationalist theories are usually explicated with [[game theory]], for example, the [[Peace war game|Peace War Game]], not a [[Military simulation|wargame]] as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.

===Political science===

The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.
Which sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are [[Democracy|democracies]] do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the [[democratic peace theory]]. Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.

Another major theory relating to [[power in international relations]] and ''[[Power politics|machtpolitik]]'' is the [[Power Transition theory]], which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of [[hegemony|hegemons]] being destabilized by a [[great power]] which does not support the hegemons' control.

Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.&lt;ref name = &quot;MilitaryAdventurism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to serious [[morality|moral]] questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=Conclusion|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: [[Pacifists]], who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.

There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: the [[Just War Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-09067-2|page=304|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; First is [[Jus ad bellum]] (literally translated as &quot;right to war&quot;), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|work=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. [[Jus in bello]], which literally translates to &quot;right in war&quot;, are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in ''jus in bello'' are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 324 In besieged Leningrad.jpg|thumb|210px|In besieged [[Leningrad]]. &quot;Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the '[[General Plan East]]'.&quot;  – ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.''&lt;ref&gt;[[I.C.B. Dear|Ian Dear]], [[M.R.D. Foot|Michael Richard Daniell Foot]] (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.'' Oxford University Press. p.88. ISBN 0-19-860446-7&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=Introduction|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in [[International Law]]'s regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;/&gt;

These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps: [[Marxist]] and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.

Marxism, and other such [[historicist]] ideals, hold that history advances through a set of [[dialectics]] (as stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]]: thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that history advances through violence. [[Marxism–Leninism]], in fact, held the belief that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple Capitalism and free the [[proletariat]]. In these theories, the question of ethics has no place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the revolution or synthesis.

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], Racism, and [[Social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-87157-X|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]].

The English word '''love''' can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure (&quot;I loved that meal&quot;) to [[interpersonal attraction]] (&quot;I love my partner&quot;). It can refer to an [[emotion]] of a strong [[affection]] and personal [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be a [[virtue]] representing human [[kindness]], [[compassion]], and affection—&quot;the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love Merriam Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; And it may describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 1956&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of interpersonal attraction, four forms of love have traditionally been distinguished, based on ancient Greek precedent: the love of kinship or [[familial love|familiarity]] (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''[[storge]]''), the love of [[friendship]] (''[[philia]]''), the love of sexual and/or [[romance (love)|romantic desire]] (''[[eros (concept)|eros]]''), and [[Kenosis|self-emptying]] or divine love (''[[agape]]'').&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Lewis, ''[[The Four Loves]]'', 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatonicSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University |year=1980 |isbn=0-691-02010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stendhal]], in his book ''On Love'' (Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called &quot;taste-love&quot;, and love of vanity. [[Denis de Rougemont]] in his book ''Love in the Western World'' traced the story of passionate love (''l'amour-passion'') from its courtly to its romantic forms. [[Benjamin Péret]], in the introduction to his ''Anthology of Sublime Love'' (Paris, 1956), further distinguished &quot;sublime love&quot;, a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love.&lt;/ref&gt;
Non-Western traditions have also distinguished [[Religious views on love|variants or symbioses of these states]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gita&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-044918-3}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt; This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define,  compared to other emotional states.

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article On Love|url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why we love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Love sidebar}}
The word &quot;love&quot; can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often, other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on &quot;love&quot; to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for &quot;love.&quot;]] [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships.

When discussed in the abstract, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.TrueOpenLove.org/reference/AncientLovePoetry.html
|title=Ancient Love Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from [[Virgil|Virgil's]] &quot;[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]&quot; to [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[All You Need Is Love]]&quot;. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as &quot;to will the good of another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of &quot;absolute value,&quot; as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is &quot;to be delighted by the happiness of another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Love is sometimes referred to as being the &quot;international language&quot;, overriding cultural and linguistic divisions.

==Impersonal love==
A person can be said to love an object, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' &quot;love&quot; of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; ''The Art of Loving'', Harper Perennial (September 5, 2000), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt; People can also &quot;love&quot; material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = DiscoveryHealth | first = | title = Paraphilia | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480-1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding of the nature and function of love.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas | coauthors = Amini, F., &amp; Lannon, R. | title = [[A General Theory of Love]] | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=0-375-70922-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot;&gt;
http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf Deﬁning the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot; /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including [[pheromones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], which act in a manner similar to [[amphetamine]]s, stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Psychological basis===
{{further2|[[Human bonding]]}}
Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (1986). &quot;A triangular theory of love&quot;. Psychological Review 93 (2): 119–135. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.&lt;/ref&gt; American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 0-201-00560-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the &quot;concern for the spiritual growth of another,&quot; and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name=&quot;peck&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=0-671-25067-1 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book ''[[The Art of Loving]]'' that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the &quot;feeling&quot; of love is superficial in comparison to ones commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, ones self, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Fromm also described Love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans comparative to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[Nerve Growth Factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

===Ancient Greek===
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word &quot;love&quot; is used. For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a &quot;pure,&quot; [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as &quot;love of the soul.&quot;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as &quot;love of the body.&quot;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean &quot;love of the mind.&quot;

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot; ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—&quot;friend&quot;—and ''amicitia'', &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot; ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[File:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|&quot;Ai,&quot; the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (心, middle) inside of &quot;accept,&quot; &quot;feel,&quot; or &quot;perceive,&quot; (受) which shows a graceful emotion. It can also be interpreted as a hand offering ones heart to another hand.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]''  (&quot;benevolent love&quot;, 仁), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (愛) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. ''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (''Wo xihuan ni'', 我喜欢你) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, &quot;[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', 好きだ). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.

===Persian===
[[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] are icons of the passion and love that the [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and language present. The Persian word for love is ''eshgh'' {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, derived from the Arabic ''ishq'', however is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for 'doost dashtan' ('liking'){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}. Over seven centuries ago, Sa'di wrote:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;The children of Adam are limbs of one body
Having been created of one essence.
When the calamity of time afflicts one limb
The other limbs cannot remain at rest.
If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others
You are not worthy to be called by the name of &quot;man&quot;.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Japanese===
[[File:Ohatu and tokubei.jpg|right|thumb|Ohatsu and Tokubei, characters of ''[[Sonezaki Shinjū]]'']]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''ai'' (愛) is passionate caring love, and a fundamental desire. It can develop towards either selfishness or selflessness and enlightenment. ''[[Amae]]'' (甘え), a Japanese word meaning &quot;indulgent dependence,&quot; is part of the child-rearing [[culture of Japan]]. Japanese mothers are expected to hug and indulge their children, and children are expected to reward their mothers by clinging and serving. Some [[sociologist]]s have suggested that Japanese social interactions in later life are modeled on the mother-child amae.

===Turkish (Shaman and Islamic)===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;aşk.&quot; ''[[Ishq|Aşk]]'' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being &quot;in love&quot; (Aşık), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for [[Turkic languages]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (eşq) and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] (ғашық).

==Religious views==
{{main|Religious views on love}}

===Abrahamic religions===
[[File:Ahava.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Indiana]]'s 1977 [[Love (sculpture)|''Love'' sculpture]] spelling ''ahava''.]]

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for &quot;love&quot; that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as &quot;brotherly love.&quot;
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote &quot;''Love God, and do as thou wilt''.&quot;

[[File:baglione.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sacred Love Versus Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poem in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.&quot; ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])
{{Close Relationships}}

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, ''&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot;'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, ''&quot;Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;'' ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

Saint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, ''“I was in love with love.”'' Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as ''“jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.”'' According to Saint Augustine, to love God is ''“to attain the peace which is yours.”'' (Saint Augustine's Confessions)

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] wrote his first [[encyclical]] on &quot;[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]&quot;. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;/&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;/&gt;  This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies.  As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

====Judaism====
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Ahava'' is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as [[loving-kindness]], is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, &quot;Love your neighbor like yourself&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] &quot;with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: &quot;See life with the wife you love&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as &quot;giving without expecting to take&quot; (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or &quot;the Loving One,&quot; which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being &quot;full of loving kindness.&quot;

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or &quot;deep kindness&quot; as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God &quot;looks&quot; at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being &quot;drunk&quot; due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article On Love|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Love.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====
[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama_in_Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prem]]a''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning &quot;loving devotion to the supreme God.&quot; A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unaldulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation)—two opposites .&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishna Prema&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything—one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visible in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the [[Gita Govinda]] and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God (taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya), and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination (krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya).  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
===Free love===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term '''free love''' has been used &lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement’s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. &quot;The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.&quot; Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of [[anarchism]], and reflects a [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to &quot;fulfill earthly human happiness.&quot; Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision on strongly defined gender roles, which led to the advancement of the free love movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurlock, John C 1988&quot;&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that love relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.

The term &quot;'''sex radical'''&quot; is also used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;, and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of &quot;free love&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Passet, Joanne E 2003&quot;&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago,IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also beliefs of [[Feminism]].

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[adultery]] and [[divorce]], as well as [[age of consent]], [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], [[abortion]], and sometimes [[prostitution]]; although not all free love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.

==Philosophical views==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
Philosophy of love is the field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] which attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of love. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love; asking if and how love is/can be justified; asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is; and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.

There are many different theories which attempt to [[explanation|explain]] what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

{{Emotion}}
{{Refimprove|date=February 2012}}
In [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and their many subsets, '''emotion''' is the generic term for [[subjectivity|subjective]], [[conscious]] [[subjective experience|experience]] that is characterized primarily by [[psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] [[Emotional expression|expressions]], [[metabolism|biological reactions]], and [[Mental state (disambiguation)|mental states]]. Emotion is often associated and considered [[Reciprocal influence|reciprocally influential]] with [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[temperament]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[disposition]], and [[motivation]],{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} as well as influenced by [[hormone]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]], [[serotonin]], [[oxytocin]] and [[cortisol]]. Emotion is often the driving force behind [[motivation]], positive or negative.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gaulin 6&quot;&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. ISBN 978-0-13-111529-3, Chapter 6, p 121-142.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book &quot;Psychology&quot;, Schacter defines emotion as a &quot;positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner. PSYCHOLOGY. Worth Publishers, 2011. p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physiology]] of emotion is closely linked to [[arousal]] of the [[nervous system]] with various states and strengths of arousal relating, apparently, to particular emotions. Although those acting primarily on emotion may seem as if they are not thinking, [[cognition]] is an important aspect of emotion, particularly the interpretation of events. For example, the experience of fear usually occurs in response to a threat. The cognition of danger and subsequent arousal of the nervous system (e.g. rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is an integral component to the subsequent interpretation and labeling of that arousal as an emotional state. Emotion is also linked to behavioral tendency. 

Research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades with many fields contributing including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[medicine]], [[history]], [[sociology]], and even [[computer science]]. The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, neurobiology, experience, and function of emotions have only fostered more intense research on this topic.  The current research that is being conducted about the concept of emotion involves the development of materials that stimulate and elicit emotion.  In addition [[PET scans]] and [[fMRI]] scans help study the affective processes in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T &amp; Gardner, W.L (1999).  Emotion.  &quot;Annual Review of Psychology&quot;, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology, definitions, and differentiation==
The word &quot;emotion&quot; dates back to 1579, when it was adapted from the French word ''émouvoir'', which means &quot;to stir up&quot;. However, the earliest precursors of the word likely dates back to the very origins of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merriam-Webster|title=The Merriam-Webster dictionary (11th ed.)|year=2004|publisher=Author|location=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotions have been described as discrete and consistent responses to internal or external events which have a particular significance for the organism. Emotions are brief in duration and consist of a coordinated set of responses, which may include verbal, [[physiological]], [[behavioural]], and [[neural]] mechanisms.{{sfn|Fox|2008|pp=16–17}} Emotions have also been described as biologically given and a result of [[evolution]] because they provided good solutions to ancient and recurring problems that faced our ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ekman |first=Paul |title=An argument for basic emotions |journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion |year=1992 |volume=6 |pages=169–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotion can be differentiated from a number of similar constructs within the field of [[affective neuroscience]]:{{sfn|Fox|2008|pp=16–17}}
* '''[[Feeling]]s''' are best understood as a [[subjectivity|subjective]] representation of emotions, private to the individual experiencing them.
* '''[[Mood (psychology)|Moods]]''' are [[diffuse]] affective states that generally last for much longer durations than emotions and are also usually less intense than emotions.
* '''[[Affect (psychology)|Affect]]''' is an encompassing term, used to describe the topics of emotion, feelings, and moods together, even though it is commonly used interchangeably with emotion.

==Components of emotion==
In [[Klaus Scherer|Scherer's]] components processing model of emotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scherer |first=K. R. |title=What are emotions? And how can they be measured? |journal=Social Science Information |year=2005 |volume=44 |pages=693–727}}&lt;/ref&gt; five crucial elements of emotion are said to exist. From the component processing perspective, emotion experience is said to require that all of these processes become coordinated and synchronized for a short period of time, driven by appraisal processes. Although the inclusion of [[cognitive appraisal]] as one of the elements is slightly controversial, since some theorists make the assumption that emotion and [[cognition]] are separate but interacting systems, the component processing model provides a sequence of events that effectively describes the coordination involved during an emotional episode.
* '''Cognitive appraisal:''' provides an evaluation of events and objects
* '''Bodily symptoms:''' the [[physiological]] component of emotional experience
* '''Action tendencies:''' a [[motivation]]al component for the preparation and direction of motor responses.
* '''Expression:''' [[facial expressions|facial]] and [[vocal]] expression almost always accompanies an emotional state to communicate reaction and intention of actions
* '''Feelings:''' the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred

==Classification==
{{Main|Emotion classification}}
A distinction can be made between emotional episodes and emotional dispositions. Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel [[irritation]] more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of &quot;affective states&quot; where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as pleasure and pain, motivational states (for example, [[hunger]] or [[curiosity]]), moods, dispositions and traits.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, N. H. (1990). Feelings as information: Informational and motivational functions of affective states. Handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior, 2, 527-561.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of emotions has mainly been researched from two fundamental viewpoints. The first viewpoint is that emotions are discrete and fundamentally different constructs while the second viewpoint asserts that emotions can be characterized on a dimensional basis in groupings.

===Basic Emotions===
[[File:Emotions.gif|thumb|Examples of basic emotions]]
For more than 40 years, [[Paul Ekman]] has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most famous work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another infamous study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].&lt;ref name=Handel&gt;{{cite web |last=Handel |first=Steven |title=Classification of Emotions |url=http://www.theemotionmachine.com/classification-of-emotions |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Plutchik]] agreed with Ekman's biologically driven perspective but developed the &quot;wheel of emotions&quot;, suggesting eight primary emotions grouped on a positive or negative basis: joy versus sadness; anger versus fear; trust versus distrust; and surprise versus anticipation.&lt;ref name=Handel&gt;{{cite web}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some basic emotions can be modified to form complex emotions. The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way [[primary color]]s combine, ''primary emotions'' could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal [[anger]] and [[disgust]] could blend to form [[contempt]]. Relationships exist between basic emotions, resulting in positive or negative influences.&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik , R. (2002). Nature of emotions. American Scientist,89, 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotions are controlled by a constellation of interacting brain systems, but the [[amygdala]] appears to play a particularly crucial role. According to LeDoux (1996), sensory inputs that can trigger fear (such as seeing a snake while walking) arrive in the thalamus and then are routed along a fast pathway directly to the amygdala and along a slow pathway that allows the cortex time to think about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, W. &amp; McCann, D. (2007). Psychology: Themes &amp; Variety 2nd Canadian ed. Nelson Education Ltd: Thompson Wadsworth Publisher. ISBN 978-0-17-647273-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi dimensional Analysis of emotions===
[[File:Two Dimensions of Emotion.gif.jpg|.5px|thumbnail|left|Two Dimensions of Emotion]]
Through the use of [[multidimensional scaling]], psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences, which allows a visual depiction of the &quot;emotional distance&quot; between experiences. A further step can be taken by looking at the map's dimensions of the emotional experiences. The emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as [[Valence (psychology)|valences]] (how negative or positive the experience was) and [[arousal]] (extent of reaction to stimuli). These two dimensions can be depicted on a 2D coordinate map.&lt;ref name=&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L.|title=Psychology Ed. 2|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=41 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10010|isbn=1–4292–3719–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories{{anchor|theory}} on the experience of emotions==&lt;!--Facial feedback--&gt;

===Ancient Greece and Middle Ages===
Theories about emotions stretch back to at least as far as the stoics of Ancient Greece and Ancient China. In the latter it was believed that excess emotion caused damage to ''[[qi]]'', which in turn, damages the vital organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suchy 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Suchy|first=Yana|title=Clinical neuropsychology of emotion|year=2011|publisher=Guilford|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four humours theory made popular by [[Hippocrates]] contributed to the study of emotion in the same way that it did for [[medicine]]. 

[[Western philosophy]] regarded emotion in varying ways. In [[stoic]] theories it was seen as a hindrance to [[reason]] and therefore a hindrance to virtue. [[Aristotle]] believed that emotions were an essential component to [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|location=Book 2. Chapter 6|url=http://www.constitution.org/ari/ethic_02.htm#2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aristotelian view all emotions (called passions) corresponded to an appetite or capacity. During the [[Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian view was adopted and further developed by [[scholasticism]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Summa Theologica|location=Q.59, Art.2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2059.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular. There are also theories in the works of philosophers such as [[René Descartes]], [[Niccolo Machiavelli]], [[Baruch Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Antonio Damasio (2005) ''Looking for Spinoza''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]]. In the 19th century emotions were considered adaptive and were studied more frequently from an [[empiricist]] psychiatric perspective.

===Evolutionary theories===
{{Main|Evolution of emotion}}
[[File:Expression of the Emotions Figure 15.png|thumb|225px|Illustration from [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]
;19th Century
Perspectives on emotions from evolutionary theory were initiated in the late 19th century with [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1872). ''The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals''. Note: This book was originally published in 1872, but has been reprinted many times thereafter by different publishers&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin argued that emotions actually served a purpose for humans, in communication and also in aiding their survival. Darwin therefore argued that emotions evolved via [[natural selection]] and therefore have universal [[cross-cultural]] counterparts. Darwin also detailed the virtues of experiencing emotions and the parallel experiences that occur in animals (see [[emotion in animals]]). This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion. 

;Contemporary
More contemporary views along the [[evolutionary psychology]] spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gaulin 6&quot;/&gt; Current research suggests that emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in [[neuroimaging]] has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by [[Joseph E. LeDoux]] and [[António Damásio]].  

Research on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see [[affect display]]). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gaulin 6&quot;/&gt; Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gaulin 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robert. Moral animal.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatic theories===
[[Somatic]] theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from William James in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as [[John Cacioppo]],&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T. (1998). Somatic responses to psychological stress: The reactivity hypothesis.Advances in psychological science, Vol. 2, pp. 87-114. East Sussex, United Kingdom: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[António Damásio]],&lt;ref&gt;Aziz-Zadeh L, Damasio A. (2008) Embodied semantics for actions: findings from functional brain imaging. J Physiol Paris. Jan-May;102(1-3):35-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph E. LeDoux]]&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux J.E. (1996) The Emotional Brain. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Zajonc]]&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, D. N., Zajonc, R. B., Vig, P. S., &amp; Emerick, S. W. (1997). Facial movement, breathing, temperature, and affect: Implications of the vascular theory of emotional efference. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 11(2), 171-195.&lt;/ref&gt; who are able to appeal to neurological evidence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====James–Lange theory====
{{Main|James–Lange theory}}
In his 1884 article&lt;ref name=James&gt;[[William James|James, William]]. 1884. [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/emotion.htm &quot;What Is an Emotion?&quot;] ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. 9, no. 34: 188-205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James]] argued that feelings and emotions were ''secondary'' to [[physiological]] phenomena. In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an &quot;exciting fact&quot; led directly to a physiological response, known as &quot;emotion.&quot; To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the [[James–Lange theory]]. As James wrote, &quot;the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, ''is'' the emotion.&quot; James further claims that &quot;we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.&quot;&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

An example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Laird, James, ''Feelings: the Perception of Self'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions: e.g. &quot;I'm crying because I'm sad,&quot; or &quot;I ran away because I was scared.&quot; The issue with the James–Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being ''a priori''), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).&lt;ref&gt;Reisenzein, R. (1995). James and the physical basis of emotion: A comment on ellsworth. Psychological review, 102(4), 757-761. doi: 0033-295X&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Dalgleish, T. (2004). The emotional brain. ''Nature: Perspectives'', 5, 582–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The James–Lange theory has remained influential. Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity. Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified James–Lange view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion.&quot; (p. 583)}}

====Cannon–Bard theory====
{{Main|Cannon-Bard theory}}
[[Walter Bradford Cannon]] agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain [[subjectivity|subjective]] emotional experiences. He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion. He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon 1929 399–421&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=Organization for Physiological Homeostasis|journal=Physiological Review|year=1929|volume=9|issue=3|pages=399–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=The James-Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and an alternative theory.|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=1927|volume=39|pages=106–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion. 

Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the [[diencephalon]] (particularly the [[thalamus]]), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that is was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannon 1929 399–421&quot;/&gt;

====Two-factor theory====
{{Main|Two-factor theory of emotion}}
[[Stanley Schachter]] formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, [[Gregorio Maranon]], who injected patients with [[epinephrine]] and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Maranon found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.  The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers )}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his student, [[Jerome Singer]], Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) ''Gut Reactions''.

===Cognitive theories===
With the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts was entirely necessary for an emotion to occur. One of the main proponents of this view was [[Richard Lazarus]] who argued that emotions must have some cognitive [[intentionality]]. The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.

Lazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order: 
# Cognitive appraisal—The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion. 
# Physiological changes—The cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response. 
# Action—The individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react. 
For example: Jenny sees a snake. 
# Jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. Cognition allows her to understand it as a danger. 
# Her brain activates Adrenaline gland which pumps Adrenaline through her blood stream resulting in increased heartbeat. 
# Jenny screams and runs away. 
Lazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.

[[George Mandler]] provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (Mind and Emotion, 1975, and Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress, 1984)

There are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgements, evaluations, or thoughts is necessary in order for an emotion to occur.
A prominent philosophical exponent is [[Robert C. Solomon]] (for example, ''The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life'', 1993). Solomon  claims that emotions are judgements. He has put forward a more nuanced view which responds to what he has called the ‘standard objection’ to cognitivism, the idea that a judgement that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgement cannot be identified with emotion.
The theory proposed by [[Nico Frijda]] where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example.

It has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.&lt;ref&gt;see the Heuristic–Systematic Model, or HSM, (Chaiken, Liberman, &amp; Eagly, 1989) under [[attitude change]]. Also see the index entry for &quot;Emotion&quot; in &quot;Beyond Rationality: The Search for Wisdom in a Troubled Time&quot; by Kenneth R. Hammond and in &quot;Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets&quot; by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[affect infusion model]] (AIM) is a theoretical model developed by Joseph Forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.

;Perceptual theory
Theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion (Goldie, 2007).A recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves ''perceive'' the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book ''Gut Reactions'' and psychologist James Laird's book ''Feelings''.

;Affective events theory
This is a communication-based theory developed by Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano (1996), that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in work contexts). This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. This theoretical frame also emphasizes ''time'' in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes— a &quot;series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme.&quot; This theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by Howard M. Weiss and Daniel J. Beal in their article, &quot;Reflections on Affective Events Theory&quot; published in ''Research on Emotion in Organizations'' in 2005.

===Situated perspective on emotion===
A situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino , emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the [[Situationism (psychology)|situationism]] approach in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Paul Edmund and Scarantino, Andrea (2005) Emotions in the wild: The situated perspective on emotion.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion.  In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms.  Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms.  In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms.  The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world.  Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.

==The neurocircuitry of emotion==
Based on discoveries made through neural mapping of the [[limbic system]], the [[neurobiological]] explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the [[mammalian brain]]. If distinguished from reactive responses of [[reptile]]s, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general [[vertebrate]] arousal patterns, in which neurochemicals (for example, [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]], and [[serotonin]]) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures, and postures.

For example, the emotion of [[love]] is proposed to be the expression of [[paleocircuits]] of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the [[cingulate gyrus]]) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[neuronal circuit|circuits]] for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of [[nerve cell]]s in the [[forebrain]], [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]].

The motor centers of [[reptiles]] react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active [[mammal]]s, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the [[olfactory]] sense, which is proposed to have developed into [[mammal]]ian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in [[olfaction]] to succeed at night as reptiles slept—one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.

Emotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by [[Paul Broca|Broca]] (1878), [[James Papez|Papez]] (1937), and [[Paul D. MacLean|MacLean]] (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the [[limbic system]], which includes the [[hypothalamus]], [[cingulate cortex]], [[hippocampi]], and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these [[limbic system|limbic structures]] are not as directly related to emotion as others are, while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.

In 2011, Lövheim proposed a direct relation between specific combinations of the levels of the signal substances [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]] and [[serotonin]] and eight basic emotions. A model was presented where the signal substances form the axes of a coordinate system, and the eight basic emotions according to [[Silvan Tomkins]] are placed in the eight corners. Anger is, according to the model, for example produced by the combination of low serotonin, high dopamine and high noradrenaline.&lt;ref&gt;Lövheim H. A new three-dimensional model for emotions and monoamine neurotransmitters. Med Hypotheses (2011), Epub ahead of print. {{doi|10.1016/j.mehy.2011.11.016}} PMID 22153577&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Lövheim cube of emotion.jpg|thumb|[[Lövheim cube of emotion]]]]

===Prefrontal cortex===
There is ample evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach.&lt;ref&gt;Kringelbach, M.L.; O'Doherty, J.O.; Rolls, E.T.; &amp; Andrews, C. (2003). Activation of the human orbitofrontal cortex to a liquid food stimulus is correlated with its subjective pleasantness. ''Cerebral Cortex'', 13, 1064–1071.&lt;/ref&gt; If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively. This was demonstrated for moderately attractive visual stimuli&lt;ref&gt;Drake, R.A. (1987). Effects of gaze manipulation on aesthetic judgments: Hemisphere priming of affect. ''Acta Psychologica'', 65, 91–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and replicated and extended to include negative stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Merckelbach, H.; &amp; van Oppen, P. (1989). Effects of gaze manipulation on subjective evaluation of neutral and phobia-relevant stimuli: A comment on Drake's (1987) 'Effects of gaze manipulation on aesthetic judgments: Hemisphere priming of affect.' ''Acta Psychologica'', 70, 147–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two neurobiological models of emotion in the prefrontal cortex made opposing predictions. The Valence Model predicted that anger, a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex. The Direction Model predicted that anger, an approach emotion, would activate the left prefrontal cortex. The second model was supported.&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, E.; Vaughn-Scott, K.; Mohr, S.; Sigelman, J.; &amp; Harmon-Jones, C. (2004). The effect of manipulated sympathy and anger on left and right frontal cortical activity. ''Emotion'', 4, 95–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

This still left open the question of whether the opposite of approach in the prefrontal cortex is better described as moving away (Direction Model), as unmoving but with strength and resistance (Movement Model), or as unmoving with passive yielding (Action Tendency Model). Support for the Action Tendency Model (passivity related to right prefrontal activity) comes from research on shyness&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, L.A. (1999). Frontal brain electrical activity in shyness and sociability. ''Psychological Science'', 10, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; and research on behavioral inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Garavan, H.; Ross, T.J.; &amp; Stein, E.A. (1999). Right hemispheric dominance of inhibitory control: An event-related functional MRI study. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 96, 8301–8306.&lt;/ref&gt; Research that tested the competing hypotheses generated by all four models also supported the Action Tendency Model.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, R.A.; &amp; Myers, L.R. (2006). Visual attention, emotion, and action tendency: Feeling active or passive. ''Cognition and Emotion'', 20, 608–622.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wacker, J.; Chavanon, M.-L.; Leue, A.; &amp; Stemmler, G. (2008). Is running away right?

{{anchor|Homeostatic emotion}}

===Homeostatic/primordial emotion===
Another neurological approach distinguishes two classes of emotion: &quot;classical&quot; emotions such as love, anger and fear that are evoked by environmental stimuli via distance receptors in the eyes, nose and ears;{{sfn|Denton|2006|p=10}} and &quot;homeostatic&quot;&lt;ref name=Craig2003&gt;{{Cite journal |last=[http://www.cba.arizona.edu/People/Faculty/Craig-A.htm Craig] |first=A.D.

[[Derek Denton]] defines the latter as &quot;the subjective element of the instincts, which are the genetically programmed behaviour patterns which contrive [[Human homeostasis|homeostasis]]. They include thirst, hunger for air, hunger for food, pain and hunger for specific minerals etc. There are two constituents of a primordial emotion--the specific sensation which when severe may be imperious, and the compelling intention for gratification by a consummatory act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Denton2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Denton DA, McKinley MJ, Farrell M, Egan GF |title=The role of primordial emotions in the evolutionary origin of consciousness |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=500–14 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid=18701321 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2008.06.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disciplinary approaches==
Many different disciplines have produced work on the emotions. [[Human sciences]] study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In [[psychiatry]], emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. [[Nursing]] studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. [[Psychology]] examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In [[neuroscience]] sub-fields such as [[social neuroscience]] and [[affective neuroscience]], scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In [[linguistics]], the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In [[education]], the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.

[[Social sciences]] often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In [[sociology]], emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In [[anthropology]], the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of [[communication sciences]], critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]'s concept of [[emotional labor]]. The University of Queensland hosts EmoNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/emonet/ EmoNet]&lt;/ref&gt; an e-mail distribution list representing a network of academics that facilitates scholarly discussion of all matters relating to the study of emotion in organizational settings. The list was established in January 1997 and has over 700 members from across the globe.

In [[economics]], the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In [[criminology]], a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as [[anomie]] theory and studies of &quot;toughness,&quot; aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In [[law]], which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in [[tort law]] claims for compensation and in [[criminal law]] prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In [[political science]], emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.

In [[philosophy]], emotions are studied in sub-fields such as [[ethics]], the [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]] (for example, [[sensory–emotional]] values, and matters of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[sentimentality]]), and the [[philosophy of music]] (see also [[Music and emotion]]). In [[history]], scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In [[literature]] and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In [[communication studies]], scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in [[ethology]], a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, [[aggression]]) in a number of unrelated animals.

===History===
The [[history of emotions]] has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars arguing that it is an essential category of analysis, not unlike class, race, or gender. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and [[social constructivism|constructivist]] school of history claims even that some sentiments and [[meta-emotions]], for example [[Schadenfreude]], are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of medicine, science or psychology. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on social norms and rules. It is thus historically variable and open to change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions&lt;/ref&gt; Several research centers have sprung up in different countries in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain [http://www.unav.es/centro/cemid/], Sweden and Australia.

Furtherly, research in [[historical trauma]] suggests that some [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of [[transgenerational trauma]].

===Sociology===
{{Main|Sociology of emotions}}
We try to regulate our emotions to fit in with the norms of the situation, based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The emotion of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Expectations attached to social roles, such as &quot;acting as man&quot; and not as a woman, and the accompanying &quot;feeling rules&quot; contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as [[love]] in the case of contemporary institution of [[marriage]]. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaign advertising emphasizing the fear of terrorism.

===Psychotherapy and regulation of emotion===
Emotion regulation refers to the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel. &quot;Psychology&quot;. Worth Publishers. 2011. p.316&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (e.g., trying not to think about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel. &quot;Psychology&quot;. Worth Publishers. 2011. p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion,&lt;ref&gt;Freitas-Magalhães, A., &amp; Castro, E.

ISBN 978-989-643-034-4&lt;/ref&gt; different schools of [[psychotherapy]] approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary [[Gestalt therapy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.123webpages.co.uk/user/index.php?user=mgc&amp;pn=10713 On Emotion – an article from Manchester Gestalt Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer science===
{{Main|Affective computing}}
In the 2000s, research in computer science, engineering, psychology and neuroscience has been aimed at developing devices that recognize human [[affect (psychology)|affect]] display and model emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Fellous, Armony &amp; LeDoux, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In computer science, [[affective computing]] is a branch of the study and development of [[artificial intelligence]] that deals with the design of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, and process human emotions. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning [[computer science]]s, [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name=TaoTan&gt;{{cite conference |first= Jianhua |last=Tao |coauthors=Tieniu Tan |title=Affective Computing: A Review |booktitle=Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction |title=[[Lecture Notes in Computer Science{{!}}LNCS]] |volume=3784 |pages= 981–995 |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/11573548}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical enquiries into [[Emotion#James–Lange theory|emotion]],&lt;ref name=James/&gt; the more modern branch of computer science originated with [[Rosalind Picard]]'s 1995 paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/95.picard.pdf &quot;Affective Computing&quot;] MIT Technical Report #321 ([http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-321-ABSTRACT.html Abstract]), 1995&lt;/ref&gt; on affective computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de//~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf |title=Recognition and Simulation of Emotions |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |last=Kleine-Cosack |first=Christian |date=October 2006 |format=PDF |quote=The introduction of emotion to computer science was done by Pickard (sic) who created the field of affective computing. |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528135730/http://ls12-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/~fink/lectures/SS06/human-robot-interaction/Emotion-RecognitionAndSimulation.pdf &lt;!--Bot retrieved archive--&gt; |archivedate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/love.html |title=The Love Machine; Building computers that care. |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |last=Diamond |first=David |date=December 2003 |publisher=Wired |quote=Rosalind Picard, a genial [[MIT]] professor, is the field's godmother; her 1997 book, Affective Computing, triggered an explosion of interest in the emotional side of computers and their users.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detecting emotional information begins with passive [[sensor]]s which capture data about the user's physical state or behavior without interpreting the input. The data gathered is analogous to the cues humans use to perceive emotions in others. Another area within affective computing is the design of computational devices proposed to exhibit either innate emotional capabilities or that are capable of convincingly simulating emotions. Emotional speech processing recognizes the user's emotional state by analyzing speech patterns. The detection and processing of facial expression or body gestures is achieved through detectors and sensors.

==Notable theorists==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
&lt;!--Please do not expand this list without discussion first on the Talk Page. This should not be a long list of all scientists working on emotion; it should just include the most notable and most-cited scientists. Undiscussed additions will be removed.--&gt;
[[File:William James b1842b.jpg|thumb|150px|William James about the time he wrote on emotions]]
In the late 19th century, the most influential theorists were [[William James]] (1842–1910) and [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] (1834–1900). James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the [[James–Lange theory]], a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=v|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/jindex/g/jameslange.htm|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Silvan Tomkins]] (1911 – 1991) developed the Affect theory and Script theory. The [[Affect theory]] introduced the concept of basic emotions, and was based on the idea that the dominance of the emotion , which he called the affect system, was the motivating force in human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Tomkins Institute|title=Applied Studies in Motivation, Emotion, and Cognition|url=http://www.tomkins.org/Tomkins.html|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the most influential theorists on emotion from the 20th century have died in the last decade. They include [[Magda B.

==Morality and emotions==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}&lt;!-- all references in this section are incomplete--&gt;
The complexity of emotions and their role in mental life is reflected in the unsettled place they have held in the history of ethics. Often they have been regarded as a dangerous threat to morality and rationality; in the romantic tradition, on the contrary, passions have been placed at the center both of human individuality and of the moral life. This ambivalence is reflected in the close connections between the vocabulary of emotions and that of vices and virtues: envy, spite, jealousy, wrath, and pride are some names of emotions that also refer to common vices. Not coincidentally, some key virtues—love, compassion, benevolence, and sympathy—are also names of emotions. (On the other hand, prudence, fortitude and temperance consist largely in the capacity to resist the motivational power of emotions.)

The view that emotions are irrational was eloquently defended by the Epicureans and Stoics. For this reason, these Hellenistic schools pose a particularly interesting challenge for the rest of the Western tradition. The Stoics adapted and made their own the Socratic hypothesis that virtue is nothing else than knowledge, adding the idea that emotions are essentially irrational beliefs. All vice and all suffering is then irrational, and the good life requires the rooting out of all desires and attachments. (As for the third of the major Hellenistic schools, the Skeptics, their view was that it is beliefs as such that were responsible for pain. Hence they recommend the repudiation of opinions of any sort.) All three schools stressed the overarching value of “ataraxia”, the absence of disturbance in the soul. Philosophy can then be viewed as therapy, the function of which is to purge emotions from the soul (Nussbaum 1994). In support of this, the Stoics advanced the plausible claim that it is psychologically impossible to keep only nice emotions and give up the nasty ones. For all attachment and all desire, however worthy their objects might seem, entail the capacity for wrenching and destructive negative emotions. Erotic love can bring with it the murderous jealousy of a Medea, and even a commitment to the idea of justice may foster a capacity for destructive anger which is nothing but “furor brevis”— temporary insanity, in Seneca's arresting phrase. Moreover, the usual objects of our attachment are clearly unworthy of a free human being, since they diminish rather than enhance the autonomy those that endure them.
he Hellenistic philosophers' observations about nasty emotions are not wholly compelling. Surely it is possible to see at least some emotions as having a positive contribution to make to our moral lives, and indeed we have seen that the verdict of cognitive science is that a capacity for normal emotion appears to be a sine qua non for the rational and moral conduct of life. Outside of this intimate but still somewhat mysterious link between the neurological capacity for emotion and rationality, the exact significance of emotions to the moral life will again depend on one's theory of the emotions. Inasmuch as emotions are partly constituted by desires, as some cognitivist theorists maintain, they will, as David Hume contended, help to motivate decent behavior and cement social life. If emotions are perceptions, and can be more or less epistemically adequate to their objects, then emotions may have a further contribution to make to the moral life, depending on what sort of adequacy and what sort of objects are involved. Max Scheler (1954) was the first to suggest that emotions are in effect perceptions of “tertiary qualities” that supervene in the (human) world on facts about social relations, pleasure and pain, and natural psychological facts, a suggestion recently elaborated by Tappolet (2000).

An important amendment to that view, voiced by D'Arms and Jacobson (2000a) is that emotions may have intrinsic criteria of appropriateness that diverge from, and indeed may conflict with, ethical norms. Appropriate emotions are not necessarily moral. Despite that, some emotions, specifically guilt, resentment, shame and anger, may have a special role in the establishment of a range of “response-dependent” values and norms that lie at the heart of the moral life. (Gibbard 1990, D'Arms and Jacobson 1993). Mulligan (1998) advances a related view: though not direct perceptions of value, emotions can be said to justify axiological judgments. Emotions themselves are justified by perceptions and beliefs, and are said to be appropriate if and only if the axiological judgments they support are correct. If any of those variant views is right, then emotions have a crucial role to play in ethics in revealing to us something like moral facts. A consequence of this view is that art and literature, in educating our emotions, will have a substantial role in our moral development (Nussbaum 2001). On the other hand, there remains something “natural” about the emotions concerned, so that moral emotions are sometimes precisely those that resist the principles inculcated by so-called moral education. Hence the view that emotions apprehend real moral properties can explain our approval of those, like Huckleberry Finn when he ignored his “duty” to turn in Jim the slave, whose emotions drive them to act against their own “rational” conscience (Bennett 1974; McIntyre 1990).

'''Medicine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|d|s|ɨ|n|audio=En-uk-medicine.ogg}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|d|ɨ|s|ɨ|n|audio=En-us-medicine.ogg}}) is the [[applied science]] or practice of the [[diagnosis]], [[healing|treatment]], and prevention of [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/ Oxford English Dictionary] definition of &quot;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/medicine?q=medicine medicine]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses a variety of [[health care]] practices evolved to maintain and restore [[health]] by the [[prevention (medical)|prevention]] and [[therapy|treatment]] of [[illness]] in [[human beings]].

Contemporary medicine applies [[health science]], [[biomedical research]], and [[medical technology]] to [[diagnosis (medical)|diagnose]] and treat injury and disease, typically through [[medication]] or [[surgery]], but also through therapies as diverse as [[psychotherapy]], [[splint (medicine)|external splints &amp; traction]], [[prostheses]], [[biologic medical product|biologics]], [[Radiation (medicine)|ionizing radiation]] and others. 

The word ''medicine'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ars medicina'', meaning ''the art of healing''.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology: [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''medicina'', from ''ars medicina'' &quot;the medical art&quot;, from ''medicus'' &quot;physician&quot;.

==Clinical practice==
[[File:The Doctor Luke Fildes crop.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Doctor'', by [[Sir Luke Fildes]] (1891)]]
In clinical practice, doctors personally assess patients in order to [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]], treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The [[doctor-patient relationship]] typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's [[medical history]] and [[medical record]], followed a medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005&gt;{{cite book | author =  Coulehan JL, Block MR | title =  The Medical Interview: Mastering Skills for Clinical Practice | edition = 5th | publisher = F. A. Davis | year = 2005 | isbn= 0-8036-1246-X | oclc =  232304023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[physical examination]]. Basic diagnostic [[medical device]]s (e.g. [[stethoscope]], [[tongue depressor]]) are typically used. After examination for [[sign (medical)|signs]] and interviewing for [[symptoms]], the doctor may order [[medical test]]s (e.g. [[blood test]]s), take a [[biopsy]], or prescribe [[pharmaceutical drug]]s or other therapies. [[Differential diagnosis]] methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=AHIMA2005&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Addison K, Braden JH, Cupp JE, Emmert D, et al. (AHIMA e-HIM Work Group on the Legal Health Record) | title = Update: Guidelines for Defining the Legal Health Record for Disclosure Purposes | journal = Journal of AHIMA | year = 2005 | month = September | volume = 78
| issue = 8 | pages = 64A–G | url= http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_027921.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_027921 | pmid=16245584 | last12 = Musa | first12 = D | last13 = Olenik | first13 = KL | last14 = Quinsey | first14 = CA | last15 = Reynolds | first15 = R | last16 = Servais | first16 = C | last17 = Watters | first17 = A | last18 = Wiedemann | first18 = LA | last19 = Wilkins | first19 = M | last20 = Wills | first20 = M | last21 = Vogt | first21 = NE | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure.

The components of the medical interview&lt;ref name=Coulehan_2005/&gt; and encounter are:
*Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the 'symptoms.' They are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called 'presenting complaint.'
*History of present [[illness]] / complaint (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom.
*Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
*[[Medication]]s (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]], and [[Home remedy|home remedies]], as well as alternative and [[Herbalism|herbal medicines/herbal remedies]]. [[Allergy|Allergies]] are also recorded.
*Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries, past [[infectious disease]]s and/or [[vaccination]]s, history of known allergies.
*Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], medications, [[tobacco smoking|tobacco]], alcohol).
*[[Family history (medicine)|Family history]] (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A [[family tree]] is sometimes used.

*Review of systems (ROS) or ''systems inquiry'': a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any [[weight loss]], change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems ([[human heart|heart]], [[human lung|lung]]s, [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]], [[Urinary system|urinary tract]], etc.).

The [[physical examination]] is the examination of the patient looking for signs of disease ('Symptoms' are what the patient volunteers, 'Signs' are what the healthcare provider detects by examination). The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, [[uremia]], [[diabetic ketoacidosis]]). Taste has been made redundant by the availability of modern lab tests. Four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination: [[inspection (medicine)|inspection]], [[palpation]] (feel), [[percussion (medicine)|percussion]] (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and [[auscultation]] (listen). This order may be modified depending on the main focus of the examination (e.g., a joint may be examined by simply &quot;look, feel, move&quot;. Having this set order is an educational tool that encourages practitioners to be systematic in their approach and refrain from using tools such as the [[stethoscope]] before they have fully evaluated the other modalities).

The clinical examination involves the study of:

*Vital signs including height, weight, body temperature, [[blood pressure]], [[pulse]], respiration rate, and hemoglobin [[oxygen saturation]]
*General appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease (nutritional status, presence of jaundice, pallor or [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]])
*[[human skin|Skin]]
*Head, eye, [[ear]], nose, and throat (HEENT)
*[[Cardiovascular]] ([[heart]] and [[blood vessel]]s)
*[[Respiratory]] (large airways and [[lungs]])
*[[Abdomen]] and [[rectum]]
*Genitalia (and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant)
*[[Musculoskeletal]] (including spine and extremities)
*[[Neurological]] (consciousness, awareness, brain, vision, [[cranial nerves]], spinal cord and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral nerves]])
*[[Psychiatric]] (orientation, [[mental state examination|mental state]], evidence of abnormal perception or thought).

It is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above.

[[Medical laboratory|Laboratory]] and [[Medical imaging|imaging studies]] results may be obtained, if necessary.

The medical decision-making (MDM) process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses (the [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]]), along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.

The treatment plan may include ordering additional [[laboratory]] tests and studies, starting therapy, referral to a specialist, or watchful observation. Follow-up may be advised.

This process is used by primary care providers as well as specialists. It may take only a few minutes if the problem is simple and straightforward. On the other hand, it may take weeks in a patient who has been hospitalized with bizarre symptoms or multi-system problems, with involvement by several specialists.

On subsequent visits, the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history, symptoms, physical findings, and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.

==Institutions==
[[File:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n5.jpg|thumb|The Hospital of [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala]], fresco by [[Domenico di Bartolo]], 1441–1442]]
Contemporary medicine is in general conducted within [[health care system]]s. Legal, [[credential]]ing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments, augmented on occasion by international organizations, such as churches. The characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided.

From ancient times, Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the [[Catholic Church]] today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced industrial countries (with the exception of the United States)&lt;ref name=&quot;IOM&quot;&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2004/Insuring-Americas-Health-Principles-and-Recommendations.aspx Insuring America's Health: Principles and Recommendations], Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccuhc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date= |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[Developing country|developing countries]] provide medical services through a system of [[universal health care]] that aims to guarantee care for all through a [[single-payer health care]] system, or compulsory private or co-operative [[health insurance]]. This is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay. Delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics, or by charities, most commonly by a combination of all three.

Most [[tribe|tribal]] societies, and the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;IOM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ccuhc&quot;/&gt; provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole. In such societies, healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it (either directly or as part of an employment contract) or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly.

[[Image:Drug ampoule JPN.jpg|thumb|Modern drug [[ampoule]]s]]

Transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.

===Delivery===
{{See also|Health care|clinic|hospital|hospice}}

Provision of medical care is classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary care categories.

[[Primary care]] medical services are provided by [[physicians]], [[physician assistants]], [[nurse practitioners]], or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care. These occur in physician offices, [[clinic]]s, [[nursing home]]s, schools, home visits, and other places close to patients. About 90% of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider. These include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, [[preventive care]] and [[health education]] for all ages and both sexes.

[[Secondary care]] medical services are provided by [[medical specialist]]s in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient. Referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists. These include both [[ambulatory care]] and [[inpatient]] services, [[Emergency department|emergency room]]s, [[intensive care medicine]], surgery services, [[physical therapy]], [[childbirth|labor and delivery]], [[endoscopy]] units, diagnostic [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] and [[medical imaging]] services, [[Hospice care|hospice]] centers, etc. Some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting.

[[Tertiary care]] medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals. These include [[trauma center]]s, [[burn (injury)|burn]] treatment centers, advanced [[neonatology]] unit services, [[organ transplant]]s, high-risk pregnancy, [[radiation therapy|radiation]] [[oncology]], etc.

Modern medical care also depends on information – still delivered in many health care settings on paper records, but increasingly nowadays by electronic means.

==Branches==
Working together as an [[interdisciplinary team]], many highly trained [[health profession]]als besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care. Examples include: [[nurse]]s, [[emergency medical technician]]s and paramedics, laboratory scientists, [[pharmacists]], [[podiatry|podiatrists]] [[physiotherapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[speech therapy|speech therapists]], [[occupational therapy|occupational therapists]], radiographers, [[dietitian]]s, and [[bioengineering|bioengineers]].

The scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields. [[Dentistry]], while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine, is a medical field.

A patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem, e.g., the Cardiology team, who then may interact with other specialties, e.g., surgical, radiology, to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications/developments.

Physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine, which are listed below. There are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in.

The main branches of medicine are:

* Basic sciences of medicine; this is what every physician is educated in, and some return to in [[Biomedical research#Preclinical research|biomedical research]].
* [[Medical specialties]]
* [[Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine|Interdisciplinary fields]], where different medical specialties are mixed to function in certain occasions.

===Basic sciences===
*''[[Anatomy]]'' is the study of the physical structure of [[organism]]s. In contrast to ''macroscopic'' or ''gross anatomy'', ''cytology'' and ''histology'' are concerned with microscopic structures.
*''[[Biochemistry]]'' is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.
*''[[Biomechanics]]'' is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of [[Mechanics]].
*''[[Biostatistics]]'' is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to [[epidemiology]] and evidence-based medicine.
*''[[Biophysics]]'' is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of [[physics]] and [[physical chemistry]] to study biological systems.
*''[[Cell biology|Cytology]]'' is the microscopic study of individual [[cell (biology)|cells]].[[Image:Tableau Louis Pasteur.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Louis Pasteur]] in his laboratory, 1885]]
*''[[Embryology]]'' is the study of the early development of organisms.
*''[[Endocrinology]]'' is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.
*''[[Epidemiology]]'' is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.
*''[[Genetics]]'' is the study of genes, and their role in [[biological inheritance]].
*''[[Histology]]'' is the study of the structures of [[biological tissue]]s by light [[microscopy]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]] and [[immunohistochemistry]].
*''[[Immunology]]'' is the study of the [[immune system]], which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.
*''[[Medical physics]]'' is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.
*''[[Microbiology]]'' is the study of [[microorganism]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], and [[virus]]es.
*''[[Molecular biology]]'' is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]] of the genetic material.
*''[[Neuroscience]]'' includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the [[nervous system]]. A main focus of neuroscience is the [[biology]] and physiology of the human brain and [[spinal cord]]. Some related clinical specialties include [[neurology]], [[neurosurgery]] and [[psychiatry]].
*''[[Nutrition science]]'' (theoretical focus) and ''[[dietetics]]'' (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for [[diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]]s, weight and eating [[mental illness|disorder]]s, allergies, [[malnutrition]], and [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] diseases.
*''[[Pathology as a science]]'' is the study of disease—the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.
*''[[Pharmacology]]'' is the study of drugs and their actions.
*''[[Photobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[non-ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.
*''[[Physiology]]'' is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
*''[[Radiobiology]]'' is the study of the interactions between [[ionizing radiation]] and living organisms.
*''[[Toxicology]]'' is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and [[poison]]s.

===Specialties===
{{Main|Medical specialty}}
In the broadest meaning of &quot;medicine&quot;, there are many different specialties. In the UK, most specialities will have their own body or college (collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although currently not all use the term &quot;Royal&quot;), which have their own entrance exam. The development of a speciality is often driven by new technology (such as the development of effective anaesthetics) or ways of working (e.g., emergency departments), which leads to the desire to form a unifying body of doctors and thence the prestige of administering their own exam.

Within medical circles, specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories: &quot;Medicine&quot; and &quot;Surgery.&quot; &quot;Medicine&quot; refers to the practice of non-operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in &quot;Internal Medicine&quot;. In the UK, this would traditionally have been evidenced by obtaining the MRCP (An exam allowing Membership of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] or the equivalent college in Scotland or Ireland). &quot;Surgery&quot; refers to the practice of operative medicine, and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in &quot;General Surgery.&quot; (In the UK: Membership of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (MRCS).)There are some specialties of medicine that at the present time do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above – for example anaesthesia developed first as a [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the [[Royal College of Anaesthetists]] and membership of the college is by sitting the FRCA (Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists).

====Surgery====
{{Main|Surgery}}
[[File:Surgeons at Work.jpg|thumb|Surgeons in an [[operating room]]]]
''Surgical specialties'' employ operative treatment. In addition, surgeons must decide when an operation is necessary, and also treat many non-surgical issues, particularly in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), where a variety of critical issues arise. Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards. Surgery has many sub-specialties, including ''[[general surgery]], [[cardiovascular surgery]], [[colorectal surgery]], [[neurosurgery]], [[maxillofacial surgery]], [[oncologic surgery]], [[orthopedic surgery]], [[otolaryngology]], [[plastic surgery]], [[podiatric surgery]], [[transplant surgery]], [[trauma surgery]], [[urology]], [[vascular surgery]], and [[pediatric surgery]].'' In some centers, [[anesthesiology]] is part of the division of surgery (for historical and logistical reasons), although it is not a surgical discipline. Other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures, such as [[ophthalmology]] and [[dermatology]], but are not considered surgical sub-specialties per se.

Surgical training in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming.

===='Medicine' as a specialty====
{{Main|Internal Medicine}}
'''Internal medicine''' is the medical [[specialty (medicine)|specialty]] concerned with the diagnosis, management and nonsurgical treatment of unusual or serious diseases, either of one particular organ system or of the body as a whole. According to some sources, an emphasis on internal structures is implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|five/000063883|internal medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, specialists in internal medicine are commonly called &quot;internists&quot;. Elsewhere, especially in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, such specialists are often called [[physician]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowler&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= H.W. Fowler.|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Wordsworth Collection) (Wordsworth Collection) |publisher=NTC/Contemporary Publishing Company |location= |year= 1994|pages= |isbn=1-85326-318-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, ''internist'' or ''physician'' (in the narrow sense, common outside North America), generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and especially surgery and its subspecialities.

Because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists do much of their work in hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such ''general physicians'' would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, [[gastroenterology|gastroenterologist]]s and [[nephrology|nephrologist]]s specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=49EF1EB5-2A57-5487-D74DBAFBAE9143A3

|archivedate=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and some other countries, specialist [[Pediatrics|pediatricians]] and [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] are also described as ''specialist physicians'' (or internists) who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system. Elsewhere, especially in North America, general pediatrics is often a form of [[Primary care physician|Primary care]].

There are many subspecialities (or subdisciplines) of [[internal medicine]]:
&lt;div class=&quot;references-small&quot; style=&quot;-moz-column-count:3; column-count:3;&quot;&gt;
:*''[[Cardiology]]''
:*''[[Critical care medicine]]''
:*''[[Endocrinology]]''
:*''[[Gastroenterology]]''
:*''[[Geriatrics]]''
:*''[[Haematology]]''
:*''[[Hepatology]]''
:*''[[Infectious disease]]s''
:*''[[Nephrology]]''
:*''[[Oncology]]''
:*''[[Pediatrics]]''
:*''[[Pulmonology|Pulmonology/Pneumology/Respirology]]''
:*''[[Rheumatology]]''
:*''[[Sleep medicine]]''.
&lt;/div&gt;

Training in internal medicine (as opposed to surgical training), varies considerably across the world: see the articles on [[Medical education]] and [[Physician]] for more details. In North America, it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school, which can then be followed by a one- to three-year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above. In general, resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery, averaging about 60 hours per week in the USA. This difference does not apply in the UK where all doctors are now required by law to work less than 48 hours per week on average.

====Diagnostic specialties====
*''[[Clinical laboratory]] sciences'' are the clinical diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis and management of patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these [[medical laboratory]] departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate [[medical technology]] degree, who actually perform the [[medical test|test]]s, [[assay]]s, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include [[Transfusion medicine]], [[Cellular pathology]], [[Clinical chemistry]], [[Hematology]], [[Clinical microbiology]] and [[Clinical immunology]].
* ''[[Pathology as a medical specialty]]'' is the branch of medicine that deals with the study of diseases and the morphologic, physiologic changes produced by them. As a diagnostic specialty, pathology can be considered the basis of modern scientific medical knowledge and plays a large role in [[evidence-based medicine]]. Many modern molecular tests such as [[flow cytometry]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[immunohistochemistry]], [[cytogenetics]], gene rearrangements studies and [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]] (FISH)  fall within the territory of pathology.
*''[[Radiology]]'' is concerned with imaging of the human body, e.g. by [[x-ray]]s, x-ray [[computed tomography]], [[ultrasonography]], and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] [[tomography]].
*''[[Nuclear medicine]]'' is concerned with studying human organ systems by administering radiolabelled substances (radiopharmaceuticals) to the body, which can then be imaged outside the body by a [[gamma camera]] or a PET scanner. Each radiopharmaceutical consists of two parts: a tracer that is specific for the function under study (e.g., neurotransmitter pathway, metabolic pathway, blood flow, or other), and a radionuclide (usually either a gamma-emitter or a positron emitter). There is a degree of overlap between nuclear medicine and radiology, as evidenced by the emergence of combined devices such as the PET/CT scanner.
*''[[Clinical neurophysiology]]'' is concerned with testing the physiology or function of the central and peripheral aspects of the nervous system. These kinds of tests can be divided into recordings of: (1) spontaneous or continuously running electrical activity, or (2) stimulus evoked responses. Subspecialties include [[Electroencephalography]], [[Electromyography]], [[Evoked potential]], [[Nerve conduction study]] and [[Polysomnography]]. Sometimes these tests are performed by techs without a medical degree, but the interpretation of these tests is done by a medical professional.

====Other major specialties====
The followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above mentioned groups.

*''[[Anesthesiology]]'' (also known as ''anaesthetics''): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also served the same function in the labor &amp; delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.
*''[[Dermatology]]'' is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
*''[[Emergency medicine]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including [[physical trauma|trauma]], surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.
*''[[Family medicine]]'', ''[[family practice]]'', ''[[general practice]]'' or ''primary care'' is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency room coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.
*''[[Obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]]'' (often abbreviated as ''[[OB/GYN]]'' (American English) or ''Obs &amp; Gynae'' (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. [[Reproductive medicine]] and [[fertility medicine]] are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.
*''[[Medical Genetics]]'' is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.
*''[[Neurology]]'' is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.
*''[[Ophthalmology]]'' exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.
*''[[Pediatrics]]'' (AE) or ''paediatrics'' (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.
*''[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation]]'' (or ''physiatry'') is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or [[congenital disorder]]s.
*''[[Podiatric medicine]]''  study of, diagnosis, and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.
*''[[Psychiatry]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with the [[biopsychosocial|bio-psycho-social]] study of the [[etiology]], diagnosis, treatment and prevention of [[cognitive]], [[perceptual]], [[emotional]] and [[behavioral]] disorders. Related non-medical fields include [[psychotherapy]] and [[clinical psychology]].
*''[[Preventive medicine]]'' is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.
**''[[Community health]]'' or ''[[public health]]'' is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on [[population health]] analysis.
**''[[Occupational medicine]]'''s principal role is the provision of health advice to organizations and individuals to ensure that the highest standards of health and safety at work can be achieved and maintained.
**''[[Aerospace medicine]]'' deals with medical problems related to flying and [[Human spaceflight|space travel]].

===Interdisciplinary fields=== &lt;!--Interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine redirects here--&gt;
Some interdisciplinary sub-specialties of medicine include:
*''[[Addiction medicine]]'' deals with the treatment of addiction.
*''[[Medical ethics]]'' deals with [[ethic]]al and [[moral]] principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine.
*''[[Biomedical Engineering]]'' is a field dealing with the application of [[engineering]] principles to medical practice.
*''[[Clinical pharmacology]]'' is concerned with how systems of [[therapeutics]] interact with patients.
*''[[Conservation medicine]]'' studies the relationship between human and animal health, and environmental conditions. Also known as ecological medicine, [[environmental medicine]], or [[medical geology]].

*''[[Gender-based medicine]]'' studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease.
*''[[Hospice and Palliative Medicine]]'' is a relatively modern branch of clinical medicine that deals with pain and symptom relief and emotional support in patients with [[terminal illness]]es including cancer and [[heart failure]].
*''[[Hospital medicine]]'' is the general medical care of hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is hospital medicine are called [[hospitalist]]s in the USA and Canada. The term Most Responsible Physician (MRP) or attending physician is also used interchangeably to describe this role.
*''[[Laser medicine]]'' involves the use of lasers in the diagnostics and/or treatment of various conditions.
*''[[Medical humanities]]'' includes the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], history and religion), [[social science]] ([[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]]), and the arts ([[literature]], theater, film, and [[visual arts]]) and their application to [[medical education]] and practice.

*''[[Sports medicine]]'' deals with the treatment and prevention and rehabilitation  of sports/exercise injuries such as [[muscle spasm]]s, [[muscle tear]]s, injuries to ligaments (ligament tears or ruptures) and their repair in [[sportsperson|athletes]], [[amateur]] and [[professional]]. The team includes specialty physicians and surgeons, athletic trainers, physical therapists, psychiatrists and/or psychologists, [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es, other personnel, and, of course, the athlete.
*''[[Therapeutics]]'' is the field, more commonly referenced in earlier periods of history, of the various remedies that can be used to treat disease and promote health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106176?query=Therapeutics&amp;ct= |title=therapeutics (medicine) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Travel medicine]]'' or ''emporiatrics'' deals with health problems of international travelers or travelers across highly different environments.
*''[[Urgent care]]'' focuses on delivery of unscheduled, walk-in care outside of the hospital emergency department for injuries and illnesses that are not severe enough to require care in an emergency department. In some jurisdictions this function is combined with the emergency room.
*[[Veterinary medicine]]; [[veterinarians]] apply similar techniques as physicians to the care of animals.
*''[[Wilderness medicine (practice)|Wilderness medicine]]'' entails the practice of medicine in the wild, where conventional medical facilities may not be available.
*Many other [[health science]] fields, e.g. [[dietetics]]

==Education==
{{Main|Medical education|Medical school}}
[[Image:Get lautrec 1901 examination at faculty of medicine.jpg|thumb|Painted by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] in the year of his own death: an examination in the Paris faculty of medicine, 1901]]

Medical education and training varies around the world. It typically involves entry level education at a university [[medical school]], followed by a period of supervised practice or [[medical intern|internship]], and/or [[residency (medicine)|residency]]. This can be followed by postgraduate vocational training. A variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education, still itself a focus of active research. In Canada and the United States of America, a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated M.D. or a [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree, often abbreviated as D.O. and unique to the United States, must be completed in a recognized university.

Since knowledge, techniques, and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate, many regulatory authorities require [[continuing medical education]]. The means through which doctors upgrade their medical knowledge include [[medical journal]]s, seminars, conferences and online programs apart from others.

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Medical ethics}}
Medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine. As a scholarly discipline, medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history, philosophy, theology, and sociology. Six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are:
* [[Autonomy#Medicine|autonomy]] - the patient has the right to refuse or choose their treatment. (''Voluntas aegroti suprema lex''.)
* [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] - a practitioner should act in the best interest of the patient. (''Salus aegroti suprema lex''.)
* [[Justice (ethics)|justice]] - concerns the distribution of scarce health resources, and the decision of who gets what treatment (fairness and equality).
* [[Primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] - &quot;first, do no harm&quot; (''primum non nocere'').
* [[respect for persons]] - the patient (and the person treating the patient) have the right to be treated with dignity.
* [[truth]]fulness and [[honesty]] - the concept of [[informed consent]] has increased in importance since the historical events of the [[Doctors' Trial]] of the Nuremberg trials and [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].

Values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation, but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts. When moral values are in conflict, the result may be an ethical [[dilemma]] or crisis. Sometimes, no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists, and occasionally, the values of the medical community (i.e., the hospital and its staff) conflict with the values of the individual patient, family, or larger non-medical community. Conflicts can also arise between health care providers, or among family members.  For example, some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse [[blood transfusions]], considering them life-saving; and truth-telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the HIV era.

==Legal controls==
In most countries, it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered. In general, this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization, which may ask the applicant to pass exams. This restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards. It is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against [[charlatan]]s that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain. While the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in &quot;evidence based&quot;, Western, or [[Hippocratic]] Medicine, they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health.

In the European Union, the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification.
The regulated professions database contains [http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?action=profession&amp;id_profession=12401&amp;tab=countries a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine] in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC .

Doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of [[medical malpractice]] and be subject to civil, criminal, or professional sanctions.

==Criticism of modern medicine==
According to [[Paul Farmer]], the main problem for modern medicine is lack of access in poor regions. There is an &quot;outcome gap&quot; between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive-to-treat diseases like [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. The majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich, low-incidence regions such as the [[Western world|West]]. On the other hand, countries in the [[developing world]] have high rates of [[HIV]] but lack the resources to treat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farmer |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul Farmer |year=2001 |title=The major infectious diseases in the world--to treat or not to treat? |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11463018 |accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medical error]]s and [[overmedication]] and other forms of [[iatrogenesis]] (harms caused by medical treatment) are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage. Practitioners of [[human factors]] [[engineering]] believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in [[aviation safety]], where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one &quot;superhuman&quot; individual and expect him or her not to make [[error]]s. Reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice. Clinical versus statistical, [[algorithmic]] diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a 1954 book by [[Paul E. Meehl]], which found statistical methods superior.&lt;ref name=Grove2000/&gt; A 2000 [[meta-analysis]] comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or &quot;mechanical&quot; diagnostic methods were, in general, although not always, superior.&lt;ref name=Grove2000&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2000 | title = Clinical versus mechanical prediction: A meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Assessment | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–30 | doi = 10.1037/1040-3590.12.1.19 | url = http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/grove/096clinicalversusmechanicalprediction.pdf | format = w | author = Grove WH, Zald DH, Lebow BS, Snitz BE, Nelson C. | pmid = 10752360 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/public-health/eliminating-health-disparities.shtml|title=Eliminating Health Disparities|publisher=American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a 2008 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/65/12/1402|title=Mental Disorders, Quality of Care, and Outcomes Among Older Patients Hospitalized With Heart Failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rural poor African-American men were used in an [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male|infamous study of syphilis]] that denied them basic medical care.

==Honors and awards==
{{Main|Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine}}
The highest honor awarded in medicine is the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]], awarded since 1901 by the [[Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet]].

==History==
{{Main|Timeline of medicine and medical technology}}

===Ancient world===
[[Image:Imhotep-Louvre.JPG|thumb|200px|left||Statuette of ancient Egyptian physician [[Imhotep]], the first physician from antiquity known by name.]]

[[Prehistoric medicine]] incorporated plants ([[herbalism]]), animal parts and minerals. In many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests, [[shamans]], or [[medicine man|medicine men]]. Well-known spiritual systems include [[animism]] (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits), [[spiritualism]] (an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); [[shamanism]] (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and [[divination]] (magically obtaining the truth). The field of [[medical anthropology]] examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health, health care and related issues.

[[Image:Medicine aryballos Louvre CA1989-2183.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An ancient Greek patient gets medical treatment: this [[aryballos]] (''circa'' 480–470 BCE, now in Paris's [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]]) probably contained healing oil]]

Early records on medicine have been discovered from [[ancient Egyptian medicine]], [[Babylonian Medicine|Babylonian medicine]], [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine (in the [[Indian subcontinent]]), [[classical Chinese medicine]] (predecessor to the modern [[traditional Chinese Medicine]]), and [[ancient Greek medicine]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman medicine]].   The Egyptian [[Imhotep]] (3rd millennium BC) is the first physician in history known by name. Earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from Mihintale in [[Sri Lanka]] where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Arjuna Aluvihare, &quot;Rohal Kramaya Lovata Dhayadha Kale Sri Lankikayo&quot; ''Vidhusara Science Magazine'', November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ihsg/publications/pdf/No-42.PDF Resource Mobilization in Sri Lanka's Health Sector]'' – Rannan-Eliya, Ravi P. &amp; De Mel, Nishan, [[Harvard School of Public Health]] &amp; Health Policy Programme, [[Institute of Policy Studies]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}, February 1997, Page 19.

The [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Hippocrates]], the &quot;father of medicine&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18392218&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blackwellpublishing.com&quot;/&gt; laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine. Hippocrates introduced the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, which is still relevant and in use today, and was the first to categorize illnesses as [[Acute (medical)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and epidemic, and use terms such as, &quot;exacerbation, [[relapse]], resolution, crisis, [[paroxysm]], peak, and [[convalescence]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=garrison97&gt;{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mart90&gt;{{Harvnb|Martí-Ibáñez|1961|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek physician [[Galen]] was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations, including brain and eye surgeries. After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the onset of the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Greek tradition of medicine went into decline in Western Europe, although it continued uninterrupted in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].

Most of our knowledge of ancient [[Hebrew medicine]] during the [[1st millennium BC|1st&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BC]] comes from the [[Torah]], i.e.&amp;nbsp;the Five Books of [[Moses]], which contain various health related laws and rituals. The Hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the [[Byzantine Era]], with the physician [[Asaph the Jew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_13493.html |title=Medicine |work=Encyclopaedia Judaica |year=2008 |first=Samuel |last=Vaisrub |first2=Michael |last2=A.

===Middle ages===
After 750 CE, the Muslim world had the works of Hippocrates, Galen and Sushruta translated into Arabic, and  [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physicians]] engaged in some significant medical research. Notable Islamic medical pioneers include the [[polymath]], [[Avicenna]], who, along with Imhotep and Hippocrates, has also been called the &quot;father of medicine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

In Europe, [[Charlemagne]] decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] likened the [[Catholic Church and health care|activities of the Catholic Church in health care]] during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: &quot;It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal&quot;. It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. The [[Benedictine]] order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries, growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts, as at the great [[Abbey of Cluny]]. The Church also established a network of [[cathedral schools]] and univerities where medicine was studied. The [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] in Salerno, looking to the learning of Greek and Arab physicians, grew to be the finest medical school in Medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[File:SantaMariaDellaScalaSienaBack.JPG|thumb|upright|Panorama of Siena's [[Santa Maria della Scala (Siena)|Santa Maria della Scala Hospital]], one of Europe's oldest hospitals. During the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church established universities which revived the study of sciences - drawing on the learning of Greek and Arab physicians in the study of medicine.]]

However, the fourteenth and fifteenth century [[Black Death]] devastated both the Middle East  and Europe, and it has even been argued that Western Europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dols has shown that the Black Death was much more commonly believed by European authorities than by Middle Eastern authorities to be contagious; as a result, flight was more commonly counseled, and in urban Italy quarantines were organized on a much wider level than in urban Egypt or Syria (''The Black Death in the Middle East'' Princeton, 1977, p. 119; 285–290).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early modern period, important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in Europe, including [[Gabriele Falloppio]] and [[William Harvey]].

The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, especially during the [[Black Death]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]'s rejection of [[Ptolemy]]'s theories on astronomy). Physicians like [[Vesalius]] improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were [[Materia Medica]] and [[Pharmacopoeia]].

[[Andreas Vesalius]] was an author of one of the most influential books on [[human anatomy]], ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nlm.nih.gov/proj/ttp/books.htm |title=Page through a virtual copy of Vesalius's '&amp;#39;De Humanis Corporis Fabrica'&amp;#39; |publisher=Archive.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; French surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] is considered as one of the fathers of [[surgery]]. Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1676, initiating the scientific field [[microbiology]].&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book | author = Madigan M, Martinko J (editors) | title = Brock Biology of Microorganisms | edition = 11th | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-13-144329-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently from [[Ibn al-Nafis]], [[Michael Servetus]] rediscovered the [[pulmonary circulation]], but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the &quot;Manuscript of Paris&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] Website with a graphical study on the Manuscript of Paris by Servetus&lt;/ref&gt; in 1546, and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in 1553. Later this was described by [[Renaldus Columbus]] and [[Andrea Cesalpino]]. Partly based on the works by the Italian surgeon and anatomist [[Renaldus Columbus]] the English physician [[William Harvey]] described the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl. 2004. ''Soul Made Flesh: The Discovery of the Brain – and How It Changed the World.'' New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Boerhaave]] is sometimes referred to as a &quot;father of physiology&quot; due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook 'Institutiones medicae' (1708). It is said that the 17th century French physician [[Pierre Fauchard]] started [[dentistry]] science as we know it today, and he has been named ''&quot;the father of modern dentistry&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v201/n12/full/4814350a.html Pierre Fauchard: the 'Father of Modern Dentistry']&quot;.

===Modern===

Veterinary medicine was, for the first time, truly separated from human medicine in 1761, when the French veterinarian [[Claude Bourgelat]] founded the world's first veterinary school in Lyon, France. Before this, medical doctors treated both humans and other animals.

Modern scientific [[biomedical research]] (where results are testable and [[reproducible]]) began to replace early Western traditions based on herbalism, the Greek &quot;[[humorism|four humours]]&quot; and other such pre-modern notions. The modern era really began with [[Edward Jenner]]'s discovery of the [[smallpox vaccine]] at the end of the 18th century (inspired by the method of [[inoculation]] earlier practiced in Asia), [[Robert Koch]]'s discoveries around 1880 of the transmission of disease by bacteria, and then the discovery of [[antibiotic]]s around 1900.

The post-18th century [[modernity]] period brought more groundbreaking researchers from Europe. From [[Germany]] and Austria, doctors [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]], [[Karl Landsteiner]] and [[Otto Loewi]] made notable contributions. In the United Kingdom, [[Alexander Fleming]], [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Florence Nightingale]] are considered important. [[Spain|Spanish]] doctor [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] is considered the father of modern [[neuroscience]].

From New Zealand and Australia came [[Maurice Wilkins]], [[Howard Florey, Baron Florey|Howard Florey]], and [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]].

In the United States, [[William Williams Keen]], [[William Coley]], [[James D. Watson]], Italy ([[Salvador Luria]]), Switzerland ([[Alexandre Yersin]]), Japan ([[Kitasato Shibasaburō]]), and France ([[Jean-Martin Charcot]], [[Claude Bernard]], [[Paul Broca]] and others did significant work). Russian [[Nikolai Korotkov]] also did significant work, as did [[William Osler|Sir William Osler]] and [[Harvey Cushing]].

[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Fleming]]'s discovery of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern antibiotics.]] 
As science and technology developed, medicine became more reliant upon [[medication]]s. Throughout history and in Europe right until the late 18th century, not only animal and plant products were used as medicine, but also human body parts and fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Cooper |title=Medicinal properties of body parts |publisher= The Pharmaceutical Journal, 18/25 December 2004, Vol. 273 / No 7330, pp. 900–902 |url=http://www.pharmj.com/editorial/20041218/christmas/p900bodyparts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharmacology]] developed from [[herbalism]] and many drugs are still derived from plants (atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, [[aspirin]], digoxin, vinca alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc.). [[Vaccine]]s were discovered by [[Edward Jenner]] and [[Louis Pasteur]].

The first antibiotic was [[arsphenamine]] / [[Salvarsan]] discovered by [[Paul Ehrlich]] in 1908 after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not. The first major class of [[antibiotic]]s was the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa]] drugs, derived by German chemists originally from [[azo compound|azo]] dyes.

Pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated; modern [[biotechnology]] allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed, sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce [[Side effect|side-effects]]. [[Genomics]] and knowledge of [[human genetics]] is having some influence on medicine, as the causative [[gene]]s of most monogenic [[genetic disorder]]s have now been identified, and the development of techniques in [[molecular biology]] and genetics are influencing medical technology, practice and decision-making.

[[Evidence-based medicine]] is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective [[algorithms]] of practice (ways of doing things) through the use of [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis]]. The movement is facilitated by modern global [[information science]], which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers. The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] leads this movement. A 2001 review of 160 Cochrane systematic reviews revealed that, according to two readers, 21.3% of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence, 20% concluded evidence of no effect, and 22.5% concluded positive effect.&lt;ref name=Ezzo2001&gt;

==Patron saints==
There are a number of [[Patron saints of occupations and activities|patron saints]] for physicians, the most important of whom are [[Saint Luke the Evangelist]] the physician and disciple of [[Christ]], [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] (3rd-century physicians from [[Syria]]), and [[Saint Pantaleon]] (4th-century physician from [[Nicomedia]]). [[Archangel Raphael]] is also considered a patron saint of physicians. In India and in [[Hinduism]], [[Dhanavantari]], a form of Lord [[Vishnu]] and &quot;Vaidyanatha&quot; meaning 'Lord of Medicine', a form of Lord [[Shiva]] are the patron deities of medicine.

The [[Patron saints of occupations and activities|patron saints]] for surgeons are [[Saint Luke the Evangelist]], the physician and disciple of [[Christ]], [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] (3rd-century physicians from [[Syria]]), [[Saint Quentin]] (3rd-century saint from France), [[Saint Foillan]] (7th-century saint from [[Ireland]]), and [[Saint Roch]] (14th-century saint from France).

'''Research''' and experimental development is formal work undertaken systematically to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humanity, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications (OECD (2002) Frascati Manual: proposed standard practice for surveys on research and experimental development, 6th edition.)&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved 27 May 2012 from [http://www.oecd.org/sti/frascatimanual www.oecd.org/sti/frascatimanual].&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support [[theorem]]s, or develop new [[theory|theories]]. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field.  To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects, or the project as a whole.  The primary purposes of [[basic research]] (as opposed to [[applied research]]) are [[documentation]], [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]], [[interpretation]], or the [[research and development]] of methods and systems for the advancement of human [[knowledge]]. Approaches to research depend on [[epistemology|epistemologies]], which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, [[practitioner research]], etc.

==Forms of research==
'''Scientific research''' relies on the application of the scientific method, a harnessing of [[curiosity]]. This research provides [[science|scientific]] information and theories for the explanation of the [[nature]] and the properties of the world. It makes practical applications possible. Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies. Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines. Scientific research is a widely used criterion for judging the standing of an academic institution, such as business schools, but some argue that such is an inaccurate assessment of the institution, because the quality of research does not tell about the quality of teaching (these do not necessarily correlate totally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Business%20School%20Prestige.pdf | title = Business School Prestige: Research versus Teaching | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Tad Sperry | journal = Energy &amp; Environment | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 13–43| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research in the humanities''' involves different methods such as for example [[hermeneutics]] and [[semiotics]], and a different, more [[relativist]] [[epistemology]]. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic. An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in [[historical method]]. Historians use [[primary sources]] and other [[evidence]] to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past.

'''Artistic research''', also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.

The phrase ''my research'' is also used loosely to describe a person's entire collection of [[information]] about a particular subject.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384 BC – 322 BC,  - one of the early figures in the development of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/saf/1307/features/knows.htm The Origins of Science]&quot;. ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''research'' is derived from the [[French language|Middle French]] &quot;''recherche''&quot;, which means &quot;to go about seeking&quot;, the term itself being derived from the [[Old French]] term &quot;''recerchier''&quot; a compound word from &quot;re-&quot; + &quot;cerchier&quot;, or &quot;sercher&quot;, meaning 'search'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam_webster&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/research |title=&quot;Research&quot; in 'Dictionary' tab |author=Unattributed |date= |work=Merriam Webster (m-w.com)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam_webster&quot;/&gt;

==Definitions==
Research has been defined in a number of different ways.

A broad definition of research is given by Martyn Shuttleworth - &quot;In the broadest sense of the word, the definition of research includes any gathering of data, information and facts for the advancement of knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuttleworth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.experiment-resources.com/definition-of-research.html
|title=Definition of Research |author=Shuttleworth, Martyn |year=2008 |work=Experiment Resources |publisher=Experiment-Research.com |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition of research is given by Creswell who states - &quot;Research is a process of steps used to collect and analyze information to increase our understanding of a topic or issue&quot;. It consists of three steps: Pose a question, collect data to answer the question, and present an answer to the question.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). Educational Research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines research in more detail as &quot;a studious inquiry or examination; especially   : investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, revision of accepted theories or laws in the light of new facts, or practical application of such new or revised theories or laws&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam_webster&quot;/&gt;

==Steps in conducting research==
Research is often conducted using the hourglass model structure of research.&lt;ref&gt;Trochim, W.M.K, (2006). Research Methods Knowledge Base.&lt;/ref&gt; The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results. The major steps in conducting research are:&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008 ISBN 0-13-613550-1 (pages 8-9)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification of research problem
* Literature review
* Specifying the purpose of research
* Determine specific research questions or hypotheses
* Data collection
* Analyzing and interpreting the data
* Reporting and evaluating research

The steps generally represent the overall process, however they should be viewed as an ever-changing process rather than a fixed set of steps.&lt;ref&gt;Gauch, Jr., H.G. (2003). Scientific method in practice. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 2003 ISBN 0-521-81689-0 (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Most researches begin with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, T.S., Hatcher, T., &amp; Creswell, J.W. (2011). The handbook of scholarly writing and publishing. San Francisco, CA: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2011 ISBN 978-0-470-39335-2&lt;/ref&gt; The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified.  A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question.  The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis.  The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.  The researcher(s) collects data to test the hypothesis. The researcher(s) then analyzes and interprets the data via a variety of statistical methods, engaging in what is known as [[Empirical research]]. The results of the data analysis in confirming or failing to reject the [[Null hypothesis]] are then reported and evaluated. At the end the researcher may discuss avenues for further research.

[[Rudolph Rummel]] says, &quot;... no researcher should accept any one or two tests as definitive. It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MTF.CHAP9.HTM Questions About Freedom, Democide, And War&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific research ==
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:Microscopy lab.jpg|thumb|right|Primary scientific research being carried out at the [[Electron microscope|Microscopy]] Laboratory of the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].]]
[[File:Alcator C-Mod.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific research equipment at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].]]
Generally, research is understood to follow a certain structural [[Process (science)|process]]. Though step order may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following steps are usually part of most formal research, both basic and applied:
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Observations and Formation of the topic]]: Consists of the subject area of ones interest and following that subject area to conduct subject related research. The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow. A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable. The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
# [[Hypothesis]]: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
# [[Conceptual definition]]: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
# [[Operational definition]]:  Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
# [[Data collection|Gathering of data]]: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from and/or about these samples by using specific research instruments. The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
# [[Data analysis|Analysis of data]]: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data in order to draw conclusions about it.
# [[Data Interpretation]]: This can be represented through tables, figures and pictures, and then described in words.
# [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|Test, revising of hypothesis]]
# [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|Conclusion, reiteration if necessary]]

A common misconception is that a hypothesis will be proven (see, rather, [[Null hypothesis]]). Generally a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment.  If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see [[falsifiability]]). However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis. This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations. In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true.

A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified. As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction. In this case a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it. Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which state no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables. A null hypothesis uses a sample of all possible people to make a conclusion about the population.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008).

== Historical method ==
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:Leopold von Ranke 1868.jpg|thumb|175px|German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795-1886), considered to be one of the founders of modern source-based [[history]].]]

The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[historical]] sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. There are various history guidelines commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis. This includes [[lower criticism]] and sensual criticism. Though items may vary depending on the subject matter and researcher, the following concepts are part of most formal historical research:&lt;ref name=&quot;Garraghan  (1946)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to Historical Method |last=Garraghan |first=Gilbert J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1946 |publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York  |isbn=0-8371-7132-6 |page=168 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research methods ==
The goal of the research process is to produce new knowledge or deepen understanding of a topic or issue. This process takes three main forms (although, as previously discussed, the boundaries between them may be obscure):
* [[Exploratory research]], which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
* [[Constructive research]], which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
* [[Empirical research]], which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence.
[[File:NYC Public Library Research Room Jan 2006-1- 3.jpg|thumb|The research room at the New York Public Library, an example of [[secondary research]] in progress.]]

There are two major types of research design: qualitative research and quantitative research. Researchers choose qualitative or quantitative methods according to the nature of the research topic they want to investigate and the research questions they aim to answer:
[[File:Hilleman-Walter-Reed.jpeg|thumb|120px|[[Maurice Hilleman]] is credited with saving more lives than any other scientist of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sullivan P |date=2005-04-13 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48244-2005Apr12.html |title=Maurice R. Hilleman dies; created vaccines |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
;[[Qualitative research]]
:Understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior. Asking a broad question and collecting data in the form of words, images, video etc that is analyzed searching for themes. This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables. It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time consuming, and typically limited to a single set of research subjects{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}.  Qualitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[social constructionism]].

;[[Quantitative research]]
:Systematic empirical investigation of quantitative properties and phenomena and their relationships. Asking a narrow question and collecting numerical data to analyze utilizing [[Descriptive statistical technique|statistical]] methods. The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive).&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. W. (2008). ''Educational Research:  Planning, Conducting, and Evaluating Quantitative and Qualitative Research.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ. Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.  Quantitative research is linked with the philosophical and theoretical stance of [[positivism]].

The Quantitative data collection methods rely on random sampling and structured data collection instruments that fit diverse experiences into predetermined response categories{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. These methods produce results that are easy to summarize, compare, and generalize{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}. Quantitative research is concerned with testing hypotheses derived from theory and/or being able to estimate the size of a phenomenon of interest.  Depending on the research question, participants may be randomly assigned to different treatments (this is the only way that a quantitative study can be considered a true experiment){{citation needed|date=December 2012}}.  If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics in order to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable. If the intent is to generalize from the research participants to a larger population, the researcher will employ probability sampling to select participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.uwec.edu/piercech/ResearchMethods/Data%20collection%20methods/DATA%20COLLECTION%20METHODS.htm Data Collection Methods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In either qualitative or quantitative research, the researcher(s) may collect primary or secondary data.  Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires.  Secondary data is data that already exists, such as [[census]] data, which can be re-used for the research.  It is good ethical research practice to use secondary data wherever possible.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.102. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-method research, i.e. research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common.&lt;ref&gt;Kara H (2012) Research and Evaluation for Busy Practitioners: A Time-Saving Guide, p.114. Bristol: The Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing ==
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 4 November 1869.]]
[[Academic publishing]] describes a system that is necessary in order for academic [[scholar]]s to [[peer review]] the work and make it available for a wider audience. The system varies widely by field, and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form. These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations. In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and [[medicine]].

Most established [[List of academic disciplines|academic fields]] have their own journals and other outlets for publication, though many [[academic journal]]s are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields; from the print to the electronic format. A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/Replications.pdf | title = Replication Research in Marketing Revisited: A Note on a Disturbing Trend | author = Heiner Evanschitzky, Carsten Baumgarth, Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong| year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its factors in order to prevent the publication of unproven findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/On%20the%20interpretation%20of%20factor%20analysis.pdf | title = On the Interpretation of Factor Analysis | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Peer Soelberg | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 70 | pages = 361–364 | year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business model]]s are different in the electronic environment. Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is [[Open access (publishing)|open access]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/Armstrong/MakingProgressinForecasting.pdf | title = Monetary Incentives in Mail Surveys | author = J. Scott Armstrong and Robert Fildes| journal = International Journal of Forecasting | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and [[self-archiving]], where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web.

== Research funding ==
{{Main|Research funding}}
Most funding for [[scientific research]] comes from three major sources: [[Corporation|corporate]] [[research and development]] departments; [[private foundation]]s, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and government research councils such as the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the USA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Scientific Grant Awards Database|url=http://search.engrant.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] in the UK. These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors. Many senior researchers (such as group leaders) spend a significant amount of their time applying for grants for research funds. These grants are necessary not only for researchers to carry out their research, but also as a source of merit.

The Social Psychology Network provides a comprehensive list of U.S. Government and private foundation funding sources.

==Original research==

'''Original research''' is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a [[primary source]] character. The purpose of the original research is to produce new [[knowledge]], rather than to present the existing knowledge in a new form (''e.g.'', summarized or classified).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unf.edu/library/guides/originalresearch.html ''What is Original Research? Original research is considered a primary source.'' Thomas G. Carpenter Library] [[University of North Florida]] {{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=XlIH4R9Z_k8C&amp;pg=PT75 Schaum's Quick Guide to Writing Great Research Papers - Laurie Rozakis]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different forms===
Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to. In [[experiment]]al work, it typically involves direct or indirect observation of the researched subject, e.g., in the laboratory or in the field, documents the methodology, results, and conclusions of an experiment or set of experiments, or offers a novel interpretation of previous results. In [[Scientific modelling|analytical]] work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem. In some subjects which do not typically carry out experimentation or analysis of this kind, the originality is in the particular way existing understanding is changed or re-interpreted based on the outcome of the work of the [[Academic authorship|researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aare.edu.au/09pap/li091380.pdf |title=Early career researcher originality: Engaging Richard Florida’s international competition for creative workers |first=Michael |last=Singh |coauthors=Li, Bingyi |date=October 6, 2009 |publisher=Centre for Educational Research, University of Western Sydney |page=2 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64cuvN4SB |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of originality of the research is among major criteria for articles to be published in [[academic journal]]s and usually established by means of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MD |last=Callaham |first=Michael |coauthors=Wears, MD, MS, Robert; Weber, MD, Ellen L. |title=Journal Prestige, Publication Bias, and Other Characteristics Associated With Citation of Published Studies in Peer-Reviewed Journals |publisher=JAMA |year=2002 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/287/21/2847.short |doi=10.1001/jama.287.21.2847}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graduate student]]s are commonly required to perform original research as part of a [[dissertation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oFFWt5oyA3oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=%22original+research%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=90#v=onepage&amp;q=%22original%20research%22&amp;f=false Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2006-2007 edition - The United States Department of Labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic research ==
The controversial trend of artistic teaching becoming more academics-oriented is leading to artistic research being accepted as the primary mode of enquiry in art as in the case of other disciplines.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesage  |first1=Dieter |year=Spring 2009 |title=Who’s Afraid of Artistic Research? On measuring artistic research output |journal=Art&amp;Research - A Journal of Ideas, Contexts and Methods  |publisher= |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n2/pdfs/lesage.pdf |issn=1752-6338 |accessdate=14 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the characteristics of [[art]]istic research is that it must accept [[subjectivity]] as opposed to the classical scientific methods. As such, it is similar to the [[social science]]s in using [[qualitative research]] and [[intersubjectivity]] as tools to apply measurement and critical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Eisner | first1 = E. W. |title = On the Differences between Scientific and Artistic Approaches to Qualitative Research |journal = Educational Researcher |volume = 10 |issue = 4 |pages = 5–9 |doi = 10.2307/1175121 |year = 1981
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic research has been defined by the [[University of Dance and Circus]] (Dans och Cirkushögskolan, DOCH), [[Stockholm]] in the following manner - &quot;Artistic research is to investigate and test with the purpose of gaining knowledge within and for our artistic disciplines. It is based on artistic practices, methods and criticality. Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOCH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doch.se/web/Artistic_Research.aspx |title=Artistic research at DOCH |author=Unattributed |date= |work=Dans och Cirkushögskolan (website) |publisher= |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, M. (2009). Draft Proposal. Journal for Artistic Research. Bern University of the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; For a survey of the central problematics of today's Artistic Research see Giaco Schiesser.&lt;ref&gt;Schiesser, G. (2012). «A certain Frustration …» – Paradoxies | Voids | Perspectives in Artistic Research Today, in: Practices of Experimentation. Research and Teaching in the Arts today. Compiled by  Christoph Brunner und Giaco Schiesser. Ed. by the Department of  Art &amp; Media, Zurich University of the Arts. Zürich: Scheidegger &amp; Spiess 2012, pp. 96-111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction, also have to do research to support their creative work. This may be factual, historical, or background research. Background research could include, for example, geographical or procedural research.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman A (2003) Research for Writers, pp 4-5. London: A&amp;C Black Publishers Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology''' is the scientific study of human [[society]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Barcan1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Barcan|title=Sociological Theory and Educational Reality: Education and Society in Australia Since 1949|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ezi2QYSjSS4C&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=31 December 2012|year=1993|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=978-0-86840-125-6|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its origins, development, organizations, and [[institution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;sociology. (n.d.). The American Heritage® Science Dictionary. Retrieved December 30, 2012, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sociology &quot;The scientific study of human social behavior and its origins, development, organizations, and institutions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[social science]] which uses various methods of [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements8&quot;/&gt; and [[critical analysis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements4&quot;/&gt; to develop a body of knowledge about human social activity, structures, and functions. A goal for many sociologists is to conduct research which may be applied directly to [[social policy]] and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the [[microsociology|micro]] level of individual [[agency (sociology)|agency]] and interaction to the [[macrosociology|macro]] level of systems and the [[social structure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddens Intro&quot;/&gt;

The traditional focuses of sociology include [[social stratification]], [[social class]], [[culture]], [[social mobility]], [[sociology of religion|religion]], [[secularization]], [[Sociology of law|law]], and [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between [[structure and agency|social structure and individual agency]], sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects, such as [[sociology of health|health]], [[medical sociology|medical]], [[military sociology|military]] and [[sociology of punishment|penal]] [[institutions]], [[sociology of the Internet|the Internet]], [[political economy]] and the role of social activity in the development of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|scientific knowledge]].

The range of social scientific methods has also expanded. [[Social research]]ers draw upon a variety of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] techniques. The [[linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[cultural turn]]s of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly [[verstehen|interpretative]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[philosophic]] approaches to the analysis of society. Conversely, recent decades have seen the rise of new [[analytical sociology|analytically]], [[Mathematical sociology|mathematically]] and [[computational sociology|computationally]] rigorous techniques, such as [[agent-based model]]ling and [[social network|social network analysis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;From Factors to Actors: Computational Sociology and Agent-Based Modeling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Computational Social Science&quot;/&gt; Sociology should not be confused with various general [[social studies]] courses which bear little relation to sociological theory or social science research methodology.

==History==
{{Main|History of sociology|List of sociologists|Timeline of sociology}}

===Origins===
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun-Kassus.jpg|thumb|150px|right|thumb|[[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406)]]
Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of [[Western culture|Western knowledge]] and [[philosophy]], and has been carried out from as far back as the time of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Plato]] if not before. The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]], i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back at least early as the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. H. Halsey]](2004),''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell(1970),''A new dictionary of sociology'', p.201&lt;/ref&gt; while ancient philosophers such as [[Confucius]] wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Islam. Some consider [[Ibn Khaldun]], a 14th century [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] scholar from North Africa, to have been the first sociologist; his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on [[social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]].

&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Mowlana&quot;/&gt; Most sociological concepts were used in English prior to their adoption as the technical language of sociology.&lt;ref name=ASR460&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Edward|title=The English Record of a Natural Sociology|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|year=1960|month=April|volume=25|issue=2|pages=193-208|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2092625|publisher=[[American Sociological Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''[[wiktionary:sociology|sociology]]'' (or ''&quot;sociologie&quot;'') is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The [[Latin]] word: ''[[wiktionary:socius|socius]]'', &quot;companion&quot;; ''-ology'', &quot;the study of&quot;, and in [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]], ''lógos'', &quot;word&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;. It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836) in an unpublished [[manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Christine Fauré and Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose'', in ''Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Numéro 15, novembre 2006: Naissances de la science sociale. See also the article [[:fr:sociologie|'sociologie']] in the French-language Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology was later defined independently by the French [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857), in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt; Comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber,  John, Linda (2010). ''Sociology'' 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: [[Pearson Canada]]. pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Comte had earlier used the term &quot;social physics&quot;, but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Comte endeavored to unify history, psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the [[French Revolution]], he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' [1830–1842] and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1848). Comte believed a [[Law of three stages|positivist stage]] would mark the final era, after conjectural [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name=&quot;comte&quot;/&gt; In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title=Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |publisher=Plato.Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus which bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as [[Durkheim]] were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism. But by insisting on the irreducibility of each of his basic sciences to the particular science of sciences which it presupposed in the hierarchy and by emphasizing the nature of sociology as the scientific study of social phenomena Comte put sociology on the map. To be sure, [its] beginnings can be traced back well beyond [[Montesquieu]], for example, and to [[Condorcet]], not to speak of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], Comte's immediate predecessor. But Comte's clear recognition of sociology as a particular science, with a character of its own, justified Durkheim in regarding him as the father or founder of this science, in spite of the fact that Durkheim did not accept the idea of the three states and criticized Comte's approach to sociology.|[[Frederick Copleston]] ''A History of Philosophy: IX Modern Philosophy'' 1974|&lt;ref&gt;Copleson, Frederick S.J.

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Karl Marx]] (1818-1883)]]
Both [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Karl Marx]] set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of European [[industrialization]] and [[secularization]], informed by various key movements in the [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]] [[philosophy of science|and science]]. Marx rejected Comtean positivism {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}but in attempting to develop a ''science of society'' nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning.

{{Quotation|To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principle achievement of Marx's theory.

[[File:Spencer-detail.png|upright|thumb|right|[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903)]]
[[Herbert Spencer]] (27 April 1820&amp;nbsp;– 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers, including [[Émile Durkheim]], defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim’s ''[[Division of Labour in Society]]'' is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer&quot;/&gt; Also a notable [[biologist]], Spencer coined the term &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;. Whilst Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a [[laissez-faire]] style of government. His ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles, especially in the [[United States]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

===Foundations of the academic discipline===
{{Main|Emile Durkheim|Social facts}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Formal academic sociology was established by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the &quot;science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] &quot;The Rules of Sociological Method&quot; 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of [[structural functionalism]]. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or [[psychological]]) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''suis generis'' &quot;social facts&quot; to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or &quot;social [[anomie]]&quot;.

Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and the process of &quot;[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, ISBN 0-7456-0830-2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field predominated in [[continental Europe]], with British [[anthropology]] and [[statistics]] generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the [[Anglo-Saxon world]]. Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with [[economics]], [[jurisprudence]], psychology and [[philosophy]], with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddens Intro&quot;/&gt;

Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist [[Max Weber]] are typically cited as the three principal architects of social science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Max Weber – Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy&quot;/&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[Lester F. Ward]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] are occasionally included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;transformation325&quot;/&gt;

{{Quotation|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with industrialization and the new social division of labor which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation'). Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasizes not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' (meaning 'control of information and social supervision') and 'military power' (control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialization of war).|John Harriss ''The Second Great Transformation?

==Positivism and Anti-positivism==

===Positivism===
{{Main|Positivism}}
The overarching [[methodology|methodological]] principle of [[positivism]] is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as [[natural science]]. An emphasis on [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.

{{quotation|&quot;Our main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.&quot;|[[Émile Durkheim]], ''The Rules of Sociological Method'' (1895)|&lt;ref name=&quot;DinW&quot;/&gt;}}

The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halfpenny&quot;/&gt; Many of these approaches do not self-identify as &quot;positivist&quot;, some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt;

[[Loic Wacquant]] distinguishes three major strains of positivism: [[Durkheimian]], Logical, and Instrumental.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;/&gt; While Émile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; He developed the notion of objective ''sui generis'' &quot;social facts&quot; to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt;

The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed ''instrumental positivism''. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favor of methodological clarity, [[replicability]], [[reliabilism|reliability]] and [[validity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gartell&quot;/&gt; This positivism is more or less synonymous with [[quantitative research]], and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boudon&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-positivism===
{{Main|Anti-positivism}}
Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher [[Hegel]] voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements&quot;/&gt; [[Karl Marx]]'s methodology borrowed from [[Hegelian dialectic]]ism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of &quot;facts&quot; with the elimination of illusions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements2&quot;/&gt; He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'). Various [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]]s and [[Human science|human scientists]] further theorized how the analysis of the [[social reality|social world]] differs to that of the [[natural world]] due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, [[culture]], and [[being]].&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, H. P. (1960) ''The Reaction against Positivism and Dilthey's Concept of Understanding'', The London School of Economics and Political Science. p307&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological [[anti-positivism]], proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbol]]s, and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify [[causality|causal relationships]] of human &quot;[[social action]]&quot;—especially among &quot;[[ideal type]]s&quot;, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements5&quot;/&gt; As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as &quot;historical, invariant, or generalizable&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Classical Statements6&quot;/&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on &quot;[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]&quot; (lit. ''community'' and ''society''). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way (&quot;pure sociology&quot;), whereas the second empirically and inductively (&quot;applied sociology&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;*Ferdinand Tönnies (ed. Jose Harris), ''Community and Civil Society'', Cambridge University Press (2001), hardcover, 266 pages, ISBN 0-521-56119-1; trade paperback, Cambridge University Press (2001), 266 pages, ISBN 0-521-56782-3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''[Sociology is ]'' ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behavior when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''prior'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.|[[Max Weber]] ''The Nature of Social Action'' 1922|&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G.

Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the &quot;''[[Verstehen]]''&quot; (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Kaern, Phillips &amp; Cohen. (1990) ''Georg Simmel and Contemporary Sociology''. Springer Publishing. ISBN 978-0-7923-0407-4. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1971&quot;/&gt; His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labor) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietzsche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition&amp;nbsp;– but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.|[[Georg Simmel]] ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' 1903|&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg ''The Metropolis and Mental Life'' in Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p324.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theoretical frameworks==
{{Main|Sociological theory}}
The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abend&quot;&gt;Abend, Gabriel. 2008. &quot;The meaning of 'Theory'.&quot;  Sociological Theory, 26:2&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern sociological theory descends from the historical foundations of functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx) accounts of social structure, as well as the micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]]) theories of social interaction.  Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of these approaches.

Presently, sociological theories lack a single overarching foundation, and there is little consensus about what such a framework should consist of.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abend&quot;/&gt; However, a number of broad paradigms cover much present sociological theorizing. In the humanistic parts of the discipline, these paradigms are referred to as ''social'' theory, and are often shared with the humanities.  The discipline's dominant scientifically-oriented areas generally focus on a different set of theoretical perspectives, which by contrast are generally referred to as ''sociological'' theory.  These include [[Field theory (sociology)|sociological field theory]], [[new institutionalism]], [[social network]]s, [[social identity]], [[social capital|social]] and [[cultural capital]], toolkit and [[cognitive science|cognitive]] theories of [[culture]], and [[resource mobilization]]. [[Analytical sociology]] is an ongoing effort to systematize many of these [[middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theories]].

===Functionalism===

{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]] as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century&quot;/&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |title=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama: Anthropological theories |publisher=As.ua.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]]. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: &quot;Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony &quot;The Constitution of Society&quot; in '''The Giddens Reader''' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theory}}
Functionalism aims only toward a general perspective from which to conduct social science. Methodologically, its principles generally contrast those approaches that emphasize the [[microsociology|&quot;micro&quot;]], such as [[verstehen|interpretivism]] or [[symbolic interactionism]]. Its emphasis on &quot;cohesive systems&quot;, however, also holds political ramifications. Functionalist theories are often therefore contrasted with &quot;conflict theories&quot; which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality of particular groups. The works of Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively:

To many in the discipline, functionalism is now considered &quot;as dead as a dodo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes&quot;/&gt;

As the influence of both functionalism and Marxism in the 1960s began to wane, the [[linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[cultural turn]]s led to myriad new movements in the social sciences: &quot;According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Philip ''The Giddens Reader'' (1993) The Macmillan Press Ltd, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] movement originated from the [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and was later expanded to the social sciences by theorists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the [[semiotic]] understanding of human culture as a [[sign (semiotics)|system of signs]]. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Assiter, A 1984, 'Althusser and structuralism', The British journal of sociology, vol. 35, no. 2, Blackwell Publishing, pp.272–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Post-structuralist]] thought has tended to [[antihumanism|reject 'humanist' assumptions]] in the conduct of [[social]] [[theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony &quot;The Constitution of Society&quot; in '''The Giddens Reader''' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] provides a potent critique in his ''[[the Order of Things|archaeology of the human sciences]]'', though Habermas and [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas. ''Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The [[anti-humanist]] position has been associated with &quot;[[postmodernism]],&quot; a term used in specific contexts to describe an ''era'' or ''phenomena'', but occasionally construed as a ''method''.

==Structure and agency==
{{Main|Structure and agency}}
Structure and agency, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: &quot;Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?&quot; In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to  factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] (&quot;What is the social world made of?&quot;, &quot;What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Constitution of Society&quot;/&gt; A general outcome of incredulity toward structural or agential thought has been the development of multidimensional theories, most notably the [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[Anthony Giddens]]'s [[theory of structuration]].

==Research methodology==
{{Main|Social research}}
Sociological research methods may be divided into two broad categories:

* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality

Sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between [[social theory|theory]] and data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methods&quot;/&gt; Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wacquant&quot;/&gt; In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson&quot;/&gt; and the very term &quot;methodology&quot; is often used synonymously with &quot;[[statistics]].&quot; Practically all sociology PhD program in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public,&lt;ref name=&quot;gm&quot;/&gt; though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.&lt;ref name=&quot;gm&quot;/&gt;

The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a [[Survey research|survey questionnaire]] to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's [[social actions]] may choose ethnographic [[participant observation]] or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or [[triangulation (social science)|'triangulate']], quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Methods&quot;/&gt;

===Sampling===
[[File:Planche de Galton.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[bean machine]], designed by early social research methodologist Sir [[Francis Galton]] to demonstrate the [[normal distribution]], which is important to much quantitative [[hypothesis testing]].]]
Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a [[census]] or a complete [[enumeration]] of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable [[subset]] of a [[Statistical population|population]]. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw [[inference]]s from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as [[sampling (statistics)|'sampling']]. While it is usually best to [[random sampling|sample randomly]], concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for [[stratified sampling]]. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates [[nonprobability sampling]], such as [[convenience sampling]] or [[snowball sampling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Methods&quot;/&gt;

===Methods===
''The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive:''
* [[Archival research]] or the [[Historical method]]: draws upon the [[secondary data]] located in historical archives and records, such as biographies, memoirs, journals, and so on.
* [[Content analysis]]: The content of interviews and other texts is systematically analyzed. Often data is 'coded' as a part of the '[[grounded theory]]' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as [[NVivo]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Patricia Yancey, Turner, Barry A.. (1986). &quot;Grounded Theory and Organizational Research&quot;. ''The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science'', 22(2), 141. Retrieved June 21, 2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 1155984).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atlas.ti]], or [[QDA Miner]].
* [[Experimental research]]: The researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgments are possible), seeking to determine whether or not certain social [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender [[stereotype]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jost&quot;/&gt; Participants are [[Random assignment|randomly assigned]] to different groups which either serve as [[Scientific control|controls]]—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.
* [[Longitudinal study]]: An extensive examination of a specific person or group over a long period of time.
* [[Observation]]: Using data from the senses, the researcher records information about social phenomenon or behavior. Observation techniques may or may not feature participation. In [[participant observation]], the researcher goes into the field (such as a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of the field for a prolonged period of time in order to acquire a deep understanding of it.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Data acquired through these techniques may be analyzed either quantitatively or qualitatively.
* [[Survey research]]: The researcher gathers data using interviews, questionnaires, or similar feedback from a set of people sampled from a particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open-ended or closed-ended.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Data from surveys is usually analyzed statistically on a computer.

===Computational sociology===

{{Main|Computational sociology}}
Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyze and model social phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Computational Sociology |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-85 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |editor=Ritzer, George|isbn=978-1-4051-2433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[text mining]], complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like [[social network]] analysis, computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MW&quot;/&gt;

Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as [[physics]] and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artificial Societies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperation&quot;/&gt; By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of [[centrality|network centrality]] from the fields of social network analysis and [[network science]]. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of [[social complexity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Computer as Laboratory: Toward a Theory of Complex Adaptive Systems&quot;/&gt; Social complexity concepts such as [[complex systems]], [[non-linear]] interconnection among macro and micro process, and [[emergence]], have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Methodological Implications of Complex Systems Approaches to Sociality: Simulation as a Foundation for Knowledge&quot;/&gt; A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an &quot;[[artificial society]]&quot;, by which researchers can analyze the structure of a social system.&lt;ref name=&quot;SfSS1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Generative&quot;/&gt;

===Practical applications of social research===
Social research informs [[politician]]s and [[public policy|policy makers]], [[education|educators]], [[urban planner|planners]], [[lawmakers]], [[Public administration|administrators]], [[Real estate development|developers]], [[business magnate]]s, managers, [[social worker]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s, and people interested in resolving [[social issues]] in general. There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, [[market research]], and other statistical fields.

==Areas of sociology==
* '''Social organization''' is the study of the various institutions, social groups, social stratification, social mobility, bureaucracy, ethnic groups and relations, and other similar subjects like family, education, politics, religion, economy, and so on and so forth.
* '''Social psychology''' is the study of human nature as an outcome of group life, social attitudes, collective behavior, and personality formation. It deals with group life and the individual's traits, attitudes, beliefs as influenced by group life, and it views man with reference to group life.
* '''Social change and disorganization''' is the study of the change in culture and social relations and the disruption that may occur in society, and it deals with the study of such current problems in society such as juvenile delinquency, criminality, drug addiction, family conflicts, divorce, population problems, and other similar subjects.
* '''Human ecology''' deals with the nature and behavior of a given population and its relationships to the group's present social institutions. For instance, studies of this kind have shown the prevalence of mental illness, criminality, delinquencies, prostitution, and drug addiction in urban centers and other highly developed places.
* '''Population or demography''' is the study of population number, composition, change, and quality as they influence the economic, political, and social system.
* '''Sociological theory and method''' is concerned with the applicability and usefulness of the principles and theories of group life as bases for the regulation of man's environment, and includes theory building and testing as bases for the prediction and control of man's social environment.
* '''Applied sociology''' utilizes the findings of pure sociological research in various fields such as criminology, social work, community development, education, industrial relations, marriage, ethnic relations, family counseling, and other aspects and problems of daily life.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What Is Applied Sociology?&quot; Applied Sociology.

==Scope and topics==
{{Main|Subfields of sociology|Outline of sociology}}

===Culture===
[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (left, front), [[Theodor Adorno]] (right, front), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (right, back) 1965.]]
{{Main|Sociology of culture|Cultural studies}}
For [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], culture referred to &quot;the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1971&quot;/&gt; Whilst early theorists such as [[Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]] were influential in [[cultural anthropology]], sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for [[Modernity|modern]] (rather than [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or ancient) society. Cultural sociology is seldom empirical, preferring instead the [[hermeneutic]] analysis of words, artifacts and symbols.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} The field is closely allied with [[critical theory]] in the vein of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and other members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Loosely distinct to sociology is the field of [[cultural studies]]. [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] theorists such as [[Richard Hoggart]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] questioned the division between &quot;producers&quot; and &quot;consumers&quot; evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The &quot;[[cultural turn]]&quot; of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structural functionalism|structuralist]] and so-called [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science and placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.

===Criminality, deviance, law and punishment===
{{Main|Criminology|Sociology of law|Sociology of punishment|Deviance (sociology)}}
Criminologists analyze the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, [[psychology]], and the [[behavioural sciences]]. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviors that violate [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., [[crime]]) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of deviance is central in contemporary structural functionalism and systems theory. [[Robert K. Merton]] produced a [[Robert K. Merton#Merton's theory of deviance|typology of deviance]], and also established the terms &quot;[[role model]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law of Unintended Consequences|unintended consequences]]&quot;, and &quot;[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert K. Merton Remembered&quot;/&gt;

The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the &quot;visible symbol&quot; of social solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar, Reza (2009) &quot;Law Through Sociology's Looking Glass: Conflict and Competition in Sociological Studies of Law&quot; in &quot;The new ISA handbook in contemporary international sociology: Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation&quot;, Ann Denis, Devorah Kalekin-Fishman, eds., (London: Sage). An e-copy available at [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1327025 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study which examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal [[institution]]s and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial [[Social stratification|stratification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Western&quot;/&gt;

===Economic sociology===
{{Main|Economic sociology}}
The term &quot;economic sociology&quot; was first used by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton1&quot;/&gt; Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and [[modernity]] as a philosophical concept. The relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]] is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of [[Mark Granovetter]] titled &quot;Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness&quot;. This work elaborated the concept of [[embeddedness]], which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). [[Social network|Social network analysis]] has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|strength of weak ties]] and [[Ronald Burt]]'s concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

===Environment===
{{Main|Environmental sociology|Sociology of disaster|Human ecology}}
Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other subfields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become ''defined'' and ''known'' to humans.

===Education===
{{Main|Sociology of education}}
The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dictionary&quot;/&gt; A classic 1966 study in this field by [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], known as the &quot;Coleman Report&quot;, analyzed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (''i.e.'' per pupil spending).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanushek&quot;/&gt; The controversy over &quot;school effects&quot; ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for [[desegregation busing]] in American public schools.

===Family, gender, and sexuality===
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&quot;[[Rosie the Riveter]]&quot; was an iconic symbol of the American [[United States home front during World War II|homefront]] and a departure from [[gender roles]] due to wartime necessity.]]
{{Main|Sociology of the family|Sociology of childhood|Sociology of gender|Feminist sociology|Feminist theory|Queer theory}}
Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many subfields of sociology. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an [[institution]] and unit of [[socialization]], with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the [[nuclear family]] and its distinct [[gender roles]]. The notion of &quot;[[childhood]]&quot; is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. [[Feminist sociology]], on the other hand, is a normative subfield that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of feminist theory is the [[patriarchy]] and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure.[[Feminist sociology]] also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bose,Christine. 2012. &quot;Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality&quot; Gender &amp; Society 26(1): 67-72&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods&quot; is also a concern.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | title = The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | date = Feb 2001 | first = Kevin S. | last = Seybold | coauthors = Peter C. Hill | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 21-24 | accessdate = 2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Social psychology]] of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley, Stephen Benard, In Paik. 2007. &quot;Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?&quot; American Journal of Sociology 112: 1297–1338.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set of experiments showed that men whose sexuality is questioned compensate by expressing a greater desire for military intervention and sport utility vehicles as well as a greater opposition to gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://willer.berkeley.edu/WillerOverdoingGender.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and illness===
{{Main|Sociology of health and illness|Medical sociology}}
The sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, [[illness]]es, [[disease]]s, [[disabilities]] and the [[aging]] process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;British Sociological Association: Medical Sociology&quot;/&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet}}
The [[Internet]] is of interest to sociologists in various ways; most practically as a tool for [[social research|research]] and as a discussion platform.&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Wilson, Researching Sociology on the Internet, Thomson/Wadsworth, 2004, ISBN 0-534-62437-5&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. [[newsgroup]]s, social networking sites) and [[virtual world]]s. Online communities may be studied statistically through [[social network|network analysis]] or interpreted qualitatively through [[virtual ethnography]]. Organizational change is catalyzed through [[new media]], thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an [[industrial society|industrial]] to an [[informational society]]. One notable text is [[Manuel Castells]]' ''[[The Internet Galaxy]]''—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Galaxy, Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society. Oxford, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge and science===
{{Main|Sociology of knowledge|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably [[Max Scheler]], and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The &quot;archaeological&quot; and &quot;genealogical&quot; studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence.

The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing &quot;with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;socofsci-bendavid&quot;/&gt; Important theorists in the sociology of science include [[Robert K. Merton]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of [[science and technology studies]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Sociology of literature}}
Sociology of literature is a subfield of sociology of culture. It studies the social production of literature and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of literature, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalisation, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally-defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.

===Media===
{{Main|Media studies}}
As with [[cultural studies]], media studies is a distinct discipline which owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, [[literary criticism]] and [[critical theory]]. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms is not in the remit of sociologists, analyses of [[socialisation|socialising]] factors, such as [[ideology|ideological effects]] and [[audience reception]], stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline ''per se'', but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.

===Military===
{{Main|Military sociology}}
Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an [[Military organization|organization]]. It is a highly specialized subfield which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct [[social group|group]] with coerced [[collective action]] based on shared [[Advocacy group|interests]] linked to survival in [[vocation]] and [[combat]], with purposes and [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns [[civilian]]-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.&lt;ref name=&quot;Core Issues and Theory in Military Sociology&quot;/&gt;

===Political sociology===
{{Main|Political sociology}}
[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jürgen Habermas]]]]
Historically political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society.  A typical research question in this area might be: &quot;Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Piven, F. (1988) ''Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way'' Pantheon. ISBN 0-679-72318-8&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical [[survey research]] by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]].  A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyze socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of [[Max Weber]] and [[Moisey Ostrogorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, S.M. ''Introduction: Ostrogorski and the Analytical Approach to the Comparative Study of Political Parties'' in M. Ostrogorski, Democracy and the Organization of Political (2 vol, 1964; 1982 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LWwBN3rUrO4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=contemporary+political+sociology&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UaGETsjbOI6r8QPgr9w0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AE |title=Contemporary political sociology ... - Kate Nash |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change.  Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively.  The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5mazSOSvqrEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+movements&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iKGETretNoia8QPL-b1i&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social movements: an introduction&amp;nbsp;– Donatella Della Porta, Mario Diani |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ethnic relations===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations|Sociology of immigration}}
The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the [[Social relation|social]], political, and economic relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of [[racism]], [[residential segregation]], and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]]. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Milton Louw&amp;nbsp;– Making A Better World.&quot; : Oldest Coloured Owned Business in Namibia. Web. 22 Feb. 2012. &lt;http://milton-louw.blogspot.com/2011/03/oldest-coloured-owned-business-in.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.

===Religion===
{{Main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. ISBN 978-0-7425-6111-3&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as a position of &quot;methodological atheism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: ISBN 0-385-07305-4&lt;/ref&gt; It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and his [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization thesis]]: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920). Contemporary debates often center on topics such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the role of religion in a context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

===Social networks===
[[File:Harrisonwhite.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Harrison White]]]]
{{Main|Social network|Social network analysis}}
A social network is a [[social structure]] composed of individuals (or organizations) called &quot;nodes&quot;, which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of [[interdependency]], such as [[friendship]], [[kinship]], financial exchange, dislike, [[sexual network|sexual relationships]], or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. Social network analysis makes no assumption that groups are the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local [[communities]] to networks of exchange. Rather than treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses on how the structure of ties affects individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behavior, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. Unlike most other areas of sociology, social network theory is usually defined in [[Mathematical sociology|formal mathematics]].

===Social psychology===
{{Main|Social psychology (sociology)}}
Sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale [[social actions]]. This area may be described as adhering to &quot;sociological miniaturism&quot;, examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behavior of small groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sociological miniaturism: seeing the big through the small in social psychology&quot;/&gt; Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, group dynamics, prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behavior, social change, nonverbal behavior, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychological emphasis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about1&quot;/&gt; In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the [[experiment|experimental method]] (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;about1&quot;/&gt;

===Stratification===
{{Main|Social stratification|Social inequality|Social mobility|Social class}}
Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, [[caste]]s, and divisions within a society.
.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, Gerber, John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc.. pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Western culture|Western societies]] stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: [[upper class]], [[middle class]], and [[lower class]], but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. [[occupational prestige|occupational]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Social Class and Stratification&quot;/&gt; Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of [[structural functionalism]] suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. [[Conflict theory|Conflict theorists]], by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of [[social mobility]] in stratified societies.

Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the [[means of production]] in the capitalist system: the [[bourgeoisie]] own the means, but this effectively includes the [[proletariat]] itself as the workers can only sell their own [[labour power]] (forming the [[base and superstructure|material base of the cultural superstructure]]). [[Max Weber]] critiqued Marxist [[economic determinism]], arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. [[patriarchy]]). According to Weber, stratification may occur amongst at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber,|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology 7th Canadian Ed.|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc..|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=243.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat.   (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth.  and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first=, Rodney|title=Sociology|year=2006|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-0-495-09344-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] provides a modern example in the concepts of [[cultural capital|cultural]] and [[symbolic capital]]. Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] have noted the tendency toward an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies.&lt;ref&gt;Dahrendorf, Ralf. (1959) Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspectives concerning globalization, such as [[dependency theory]], suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornschier V. (1996), 'Western society in transition' New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban and rural sociology===
{{Main|Urban sociology|Rural sociology}}
Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the [[industrial revolution]], works such as [[Georg Simmel]]'s ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilising [[symbolic interactionism]] as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of [[globalization]], for instance, in [[Saskia Sassen]]'s study of the &quot;[[Global city]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia&amp;nbsp;– The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo. (1991)&amp;nbsp;– Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-07063-6&lt;/ref&gt; Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas.

===Work and industry===
{{Main|Industrial sociology}}
The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines &quot;the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Tony J. 2008 ''Sociology, Work, and Industry''. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-43555-2. p392&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology and the other academic disciplines==
Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular [[anthropology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], and [[social philosophy]]. Many comparatively new fields such as [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[demography]] and [[literary theory]], draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms &quot;[[social science]]&quot; and &quot;[[social research]]&quot; have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of [[social psychology]] emerged from the many intersections of sociological and psychological interests, and is further distinguished in terms of [[social psychology (sociology)|sociological]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychological emphasis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M., and CW Sherif. An Outline of Social Psychology (rev. ed.). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociology and [[applied sociology]] are connected to the professional and academic discipline of [[social work]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Web page&quot;/&gt; Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Generalist Practice with Organizations and Communities&quot;/&gt;  However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Direct Social Work Practice&quot;/&gt;  For example, a sociologist might study ''why'' a community is plagued with poverty.  The [[applied sociology|applied sociologist]] would be more focused on practical strategies on ''what'' needs to be done to alleviate this burden.  The social worker would be focused on ''action''; implementing theses strategies [[clinical social work|&quot;directly&quot;]] or [[Community practice|&quot;indirectly&quot;]] by means of [[mental health|mental health therapy]], [[counseling]], [[advocacy]], [[community organization]] or [[community mobilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Generalist Practice with Organizations and Communities&quot;/&gt;

[[Social anthropology]] is the branch of [[anthropology]] that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in [[social group]]s. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of [[social organization]]. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Trostle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sociology-Basic Concepts&quot;/&gt;

[[Sociobiology]] is the study of how [[social behavior]] and organization have been influenced by [[evolution]] and other [[biological process]]. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, [[biology]], and [[zoology]]. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see '[[nature versus nurture]]'). [[Entomology|Entomologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology.&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, David. &quot;NOVA: Lord of the Ants.&quot; NOVA: Lord of the Ants. Dir. David Dugan. Prod. David Dugan. PBS. WGBH, Boston, Massachusetts, 20 May 2008. Television.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irving Louis Horowitz]], in his ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' (1994), has argued that the discipline, whilst arriving from a &quot;distinguished lineage and tradition&quot;, is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: &quot;The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1994&quot;/&gt; Furthermore: &quot;A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1994&quot;/&gt; Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. [[Randall Collins]], the [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]] Professor in Sociology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] journal, has voiced similar sentiments: &quot;we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Cited in Horowitz, Irving (1994) ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' Oxford University Press. p3-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education Guide]]'' published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' (including philosophy and psychology). Seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists: [[Michel Foucault]] (1), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (2), [[Anthony Giddens]] (5), [[Erving Goffman]] (6), [[Jürgen Habermas]] (7), [[Max Weber]] (8), and [[Bruno Latour]] (10).&lt;ref name=&quot;The most cited authors of books in the humanities&quot;/&gt;

==Journals==
{{See also|List of sociology journals}}
The most highly ranked general journals which publish original research in the field of sociology are the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', and the ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=WoS/&gt;  The ''[[Annual Review of Sociology]]'', which publishes literature reviews, is also highly ranked.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite web |year=2011 |chapter=Sociology Journals ranked by 5-year Impact Factor |title=2011 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |accessdate=2013-04-22 |work=Web of Science |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other generalist and specialized journals exist.

[[File:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|upright|A stack of gold bars, which historically symbolized wealth.]]
'''Wealth''' is the [[abundance (economics)|abundance]] of [[Value (economics)|valuable]] [[resource]]s or material [[Property|possessions]]. The [[word]] wealth is derived from the old English ''weal'', which is from an [[Indo-European]] word stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/wealth |title=wealth |publisher=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th ed. |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual, community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources is known as wealthy.

The concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of [[economics]], and clearly so for [[growth economics]] and [[development economics]] yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent. At the most general level, economists may define wealth as &quot;anything of value&quot; which captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept. Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.&lt;ref name=&quot;goulet&quot;&gt;Denis &quot;Authentic Development: Is it Sustainable?&quot;, pp. 189-205 in ''Building Sustainable Societies'', Dennis Pirages, ed., [[M. E. Sharpe]], ISBN 1-56324-738-0, ISBN 978-1-56324-738-5. (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Defining wealth can be a [[normative]] process with various [[ethical]] implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/467637 |first=Anthony T. |last=Kronman |title=Wealth Maximization as a Normative Principle |publisher=[[The Journal of Legal Studies]] |volume= 9 |date=March 1980 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heilbroner&quot;&gt;[[Robert L. Heilbroner]], 1987 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics|2008]]. ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 880-83.

The [[United Nations]] definition of ''inclusive wealth'' is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human and physical assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;wealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Sponsored by |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21557732 |title=Free exchange: The real wealth of nations |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr |title=Inclusive Wealth Report - IHDP |publisher=Ihdp.unu.edu |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural capital includes land, forests, [[fossil fuels]], and minerals.  Human capital is the population's education and skills.  Physical (or &quot;manufactured&quot;) capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure.

==Definition==
For definitions of &quot;wealth,&quot; see also ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and [[Max Weber]], ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

[[Adam Smith]], in his seminal work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', described wealth as &quot;the annual produce of the land and labour of the society&quot;. This &quot;produce&quot; is, at its simplest, that which satisfies human needs and wants of [[utility]]. In popular usage, wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic [[Value (economics)|value]], or the state of controlling or possessing such items, usually in the form of [[money]], [[real estate]] and personal [[property (ownership right)|property]]. An individual who is considered wealthy, affluent, or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group. In economics, [[Wealth (economics)|net wealth]] refers to the value of [[assets]] owned minus the value of [[liability (accounting)|liabilities]] owed at a point in time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Wealth can be categorized into three principal categories: [[personal property]], including homes or automobiles; monetary savings, such as the accumulation of past [[income]]; and the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] wealth of income producing assets, including [[real estate]], [[stocks]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and [[business]]es.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} All these delineations make wealth an especially important part of [[social stratification]]. Wealth provides a type of [[social safety net]] of protection against an unforeseen decline in one’s living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership, business ownership, or even a college education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt; {{Failed verification|date=September 2008}}

'Wealth' refers to some ''accumulation'' of resources (net asset value), whether abundant or not. 'Richness' refers to an ''abundance'' of such resources (income or flow). A wealthy individual, community, or nation thus has more accumulated resources (capital) than a poor one. The opposite of wealth is destitution. The opposite of richness is [[poverty]].

The term implies a [[social contract]] on establishing and maintaining [[ownership]] in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner. The concept of wealth is relative and not only varies between societies, but varies between different sections or regions in the same society. A personal [[net worth]] of US $10,000 in most parts of the United States would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale. However, such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished [[developing country|developing countries]].

Concepts of wealth also vary across time. Modern labor-saving inventions and the development of the [[sciences]] have enabled the poorest sectors of today's society to enjoy a [[standard of living]] equivalent if not superior to the wealthy of the not-too-distant past. This comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future; given this trend{{cn|date=July 2012}} of human advancement, it is likely that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations.

[[Industrialization]] emphasized the role of technology. Many jobs were automated. Machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized. [[Labour specialization]] became critical to economic success. However, [[physical capital]], as it came to be known, consisting of both the [[natural capital]] and the [[infrastructural capital]], became the focus of the ''analysis of wealth''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Adam Smith]] saw wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology in such a way as to capture a profit (excess above the cost of production).&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;&gt;Smith, Adam. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3300 An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]''&lt;/ref&gt; The theories of [[David Ricardo]], [[John Locke]], [[John Stuart Mill]], in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call [[classical economics]].

[[Marxian]] economics (''see [[labor theory of value]]'') distinguishes in the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' between material wealth and human wealth, defining human wealth as &quot;wealth in human relations&quot;; land and labour were the source of all material wealth.

==Economic analysis==
In [[economics]], wealth in a commonly applied [[accounting]] sense is the [[net worth]] of a person, household, or nation, that is, the value of all [[asset]]s owned net of all [[Liability (accounting)|liabilities]] owed at a point in time.

Economic terminology distinguishes between wealth and income.  Wealth is a ''[[Stock and flow|stock]]'' variable, that is, measurable ''at a date'' in time, for example the value of an orchard on December 31 minus debt owed on the orchard. For a given amount of wealth, say at the beginning of the year, [[Income#Economic definitions|income]] from that wealth, as measurable ''over'' say a year is a ''[[Stock and flow|flow]]'' variable. What marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time, such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year.

In [[macroeconomic]] theory the '[[wealth effect]]' may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth. One measure of it is the [[wealth elasticity of demand]]. It is the percentage change in the amount demanded of [[National Income and Product Accounts#Accounting for national product: the right side of the report|consumption]] for each one-percent change in wealth.

Wealth may be measured in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal or real values]], that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible ([[land (economics)|land]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]) and ''financial'' (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as [[human capital]] and [[social capital]]. In economics, 'wealth' corresponds to the [[accounting]] term '[[net worth]]'. But analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting (such as in [[national accounts]]). An example of the latter is [[generational accounting]] of [[social security]] systems to include the [[present value]] projected future outlays considered to be liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;• Jagadeesh Gokhale, 2008. &quot;Generational accounting.&quot; ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.

Kotlikoff, 1992, ''Generational Accounting''.

Barro]], 1974. &quot;Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?&quot;, ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', 8(6), pp. [http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Teaching_Folder/Econ_202b_F2000/papers/Barro,_Bonds_Net_Wealth.pdf#page=2 1095-1111.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Environmental assets]] are not usually counted in measuring wealth, in part due to the difficulty of valuation for a [[public good|non-market good]]. Environmental or [[green accounting]] is a method of [[national accounts|social accounting]] for formulating and deriving such measures on the argument that an educated valuation is superior to a value of zero (as the implied valuation of environmental assets).&lt;ref&gt;• Sjak Smulders, 2008. &quot;green national accounting,&quot; ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

==Sociological treatments==
{{POV-section|date=April 2010}}
{{Globalize|date=July 2011}}
&quot;Wealth provides an important mechanism in the intergenerational transmission of inequality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;&gt;[[Dennis Gilbert|Gilbert, Dennis]]. The American Class Structure in an Age of Growing Inequality . N.p.: [[Wadsworth Publishing]];, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 10% of the wealthiest people in America inherited family fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} But the effect of inherited wealth can also be seen on a more modest level. For example, a couple who buy a house with financial help from their parents or a student who has his or her college education paid for; in both scenarios the participants are benefiting directly from the accumulated wealth of previous generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt;

===Wealth and social class===
[[Social class]] is not identical to wealth, but the two concepts are related (particularly in [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]]), leading to the combined concept of [[Socioeconomic status]].

Partly as a result of different economic conditions of life, members of different [[social classes]] often have different value systems and view the world in different ways. As such, there exist different &quot;conceptions of social reality, different aspirations and hopes and fears, different conceptions of the desirable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Poverty. Ed. Ben B Seligman. New York: [[Thomas Y. Crowell Co.]], 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes. According to Richard H Ropers, the [[Wealth concentration|concentration of wealth]] in the United States is inequitably distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Ropers, Richard H, Ph.D. Persistent Poverty: The American Dream Turned Nightmare. New York: Insight Books, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the United States federal government reported that the net worth of the top 1 percent of people in the United States was approximately equal to that of the bottom 90 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadsworth Publishing 2002&quot;/&gt;

====The Class====
The class standard valuation is different in each country according to their [[GDP (nominal)]].

====The upper class====
[[Upper class]] values include higher education, and the wealthiest people the accumulation and maintenance of wealth, the maintenance of social networks and the power that accompanies such networks. Children of the upper class are typically schooled on how to manage this power and channel this privilege in different forms. It is in large part by accessing various edifices of information,{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} associates, procedures and auspices that the upper class are able to maintain their wealth and pass it to future generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;&gt;Sherraden, Michael. Assets and the Poor: A New American Welfare Policy. Armonk: [[M. E. Sharpe]], Inc., 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The middle class====
The middle class places a greater emphasis on income. The [[middle class]] views wealth as something for emergencies and it is seen as more of a cushion. This class comprises people that were raised with families that typically owned their own home, planned ahead and stressed the importance of education and achievement. They earn a significant amount of income and also have significant amounts of consumption. However there is very limited savings (deferred consumption) or investments, besides retirement [[pension]]s and homeownership. They have been socialized to accumulate wealth through structured, institutionalized arrangements. Without this set structure, asset accumulation would likely not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;/&gt;

====The lower class====
Those with the least amount of wealth are the poor. (see [[underclass]]) Wealth accumulation for this class is to some extent prohibited. People that receive [[AFDC]] transfers cannot own more than a trivial amount of assets, in order to be eligible and remain qualified for income transfers. Most of the institutions that the poor encounter discourage any accumulation of assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherraden, Michael 1991&quot;/&gt;

===Distribution===
{{Main|Distribution of wealth}}

Although precise data are not available, the total [[household wealth]] in the world, excluding [[human capital]], has been estimated at $125 [[10^12|trillion]] (USD 125 x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) in year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wider.unu.edu/events/past-events/2006-events/en_GB/05-12-2006/ |publisher=Wider.unu.edu |title= The World Distribution of Household Wealth |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Including human capital, the United Nations estimated it in 2008 to be $118 trillion in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;wealth&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/iwr |title=Inclusive Wealth Report - IHDP |publisher=Ihdp.unu.edu |date=2012-07-09 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 90% of global wealth is distributed in North America, Europe, and &quot;rich [[Asia-Pacific]]&quot; countries (not including India),&lt;ref&gt;James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. (2008). [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2008/en_GB/dp2008-03/ The World Distribution of Household Wealth, p8]. UNU-WIDER.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1% of adults are estimated to hold 40% of world wealth, a number which falls to 32% when adjusted for [[purchasing power parity]].&lt;ref&gt;James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, Anthony Shorrocks, and Edward N. Wolff. (2008). [http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/working-papers/discussion-papers/2008/en_GB/dp2008-03/ The World Distribution of Household Wealth]. UNU-WIDER.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth in the form of land==
In the western tradition, the concepts of owning land and accumulating wealth in the form of land were engendered in the rise of the first [[State (polity)|state]], for a primary service and power of government was, and is to this day, the awarding and [[adjudication]] of [[land use rights]].

Land ownership was also justified according to [[John Locke]]. He claimed that because we mix{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} our labour with the land, we thereby deserve the right to control the use of the land and benefit from the product of that land (but subject to his [[Lockean proviso]] of &quot;at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot;).

Additionally, in developed countries post-[[agrarian society]] ([[industrial society]]) this argument has many critics (including those influenced by [[Georgist]] and [[geolibertarian]] ideas) who argue that since land, by definition, is not a product of human labor, any claim of [[private property]] in it is a form of theft; as [[David Lloyd George]] observed, &quot;to prove a legal title to land one must trace it back to the man who stole it.&quot;

Many older ideas have resurfaced in the modern notions of [[ecological stewardship]], [[bioregionalism]], [[natural capital]], and [[ecological economics]].

==Anthropological views==
[[Anthropology]] characterizes societies, in part, based on a society's concept of wealth, and the institutional structures and [[power (sociology)|power]] used to protect this wealth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Several types are defined below. They can be viewed as an evolutionary progression.  Many young adolescents have become wealthy from the inheritance of their families.  

===The interpersonal concept===
Early [[Hominidae|hominid]]s seem to have started with incipient ideas of wealth,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} similar to that of the [[great ape]]s. But as tools, [[clothing]], and other mobile [[infrastructural capital]] became important to survival (especially in hostile [[biome]]s), ideas such as the [[inheritance]] of wealth, political positions,  [[leadership]], and ability to control group movements (to perhaps reinforce such power) emerged. [[Neandertal]] societies had pooled [[funerary rite]]s and [[cave painting]] which implies at least a notion of shared assets that could be spent for social purposes, or preserved for social purposes. Wealth may have been collective.

===Accumulation of non-necessities===
[[Human]]s back to and including the [[Cro-Magnon]]s seem to have had clearly defined rulers and status hierarchies.  [[Archaeology|Digs]] in [[Russia]] have revealed elaborate funeral clothing on a pair of children buried there over 35,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This indicates a considerable accumulation of wealth by some individuals or families. The high [[artisan]] skill also suggest the capacity to direct [[labour specialization|specialized labor]] to tasks that are not of any obvious utility to the group's survival.

===Control of arable land===
The rise of [[irrigation]] and [[urbanization]], especially in ancient [[Sumer]] and later [[Egypt]], unified the ideas of wealth and control of [[Real property|land]] and [[agriculture]]. To feed a large stable population, it was possible and necessary to achieve universal [[wikt:cultivation|cultivation]] and [[city-state]] protection. The notion of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the notion of [[war]] are said to have emerged at this time. Tribal cultures were formalized into what we would call feudal systems, and many rights and obligations were assumed by the [[monarchy]] and related [[aristocracy]]. Protection of [[infrastructural capital]] built up over generations became critical: [[city wall]]s, [[irrigation system]]s, [[sewage system]]s, [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]], [[building]]s, all impossible to replace within a single generation, and thus a matter of social survival to maintain. The [[social capital]] of entire societies was often defined in terms of its relation to [[infrastructural capital]] (e.g. [[castle]]s or [[fort]]s or an allied [[monastery]], [[cathedral]] or [[temple]]), and [[natural capital]], (i.e. the [[Soil|land]] that supplied locally grown food). [[Agricultural economics]] continues these traditions in the analyses of modern [[agricultural policy]] and related ideas of wealth, e.g. the ark of taste model of agricultural wealth.

===The role of technology===

[[Industrialization]] emphasized the role of technology. Many jobs were automated. Machines replaced some workers while other workers became more specialized. [[Labour specialization]] became critical to economic success.  However, [[physical capital]], as it came to be known, consisting of both the [[natural capital]] (raw materials from nature) and the [[infrastructural capital]] (facilitating technology), became the focus of the '''analysis of wealth'''.  [[Adam Smith]] saw wealth creation as the combination of materials, labour, land, and technology in such a way as to capture a profit (excess above the cost of production).&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg1&quot;/&gt;

{{Science}}
'''Science''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''scientia'', meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes [[knowledge]] in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the [[universe]].&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Wilson |first1 = Edward O. |title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge |edition=1st |publisher = Vintage Books |location = New York, NY |year = 1998 |isbn = 0-679-45077-7 |pages=49–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... modern science is a discovery as well as an invention.

&lt;!--{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=3}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an older and closely related meaning, &quot;science&quot; also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. Since [[classical antiquity]], science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to [[philosophy]]. In the [[early modern period]] the words &quot;science&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; were sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[David C. Lindberg]] (2007), ''The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context'',  Second ed. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press ISBN 978-0-226-48205-7, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; By the 17th century, [[natural philosophy]] (which is today called &quot;[[natural science]]&quot;) was considered a separate branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, and reflects the then-current use of the words &quot;[[natural philosophy]]&quot;, akin to &quot;systematic study of nature&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;science&quot; continued to be used in a broad sense denoting reliable knowledge about a topic, in the same way it is still used in modern terms such as [[library science]] or [[political science]].

In modern use, &quot;science&quot; more often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. It is &quot;often treated as synonymous with 'natural and physical science', and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws, sometimes with implied exclusion of pure mathematics. This is now the dominant sense in ordinary use.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This narrower sense of &quot;science&quot; developed as scientists such as [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]] began formulating ''[[laws of nature]]'' such as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as &quot;natural science&quot;. Over the course of the 19th century, the word &quot;science&quot; became increasingly associated with the [[scientific method]], a disciplined way to study the natural world, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]] and [[biology]]. It is in the 19th century also that the term ''[[scientist]]'' was created by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought knowledge on other disciplines. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word &quot;scientist&quot; to 1834. This sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as [[social science]]. Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of &quot;science&quot;, such as [[formal science]] and [[applied science]].

===History===
{{Main|History of science}}
[[File:Riccio Melone a Capo Caccia adventurediving.it.jpg|thumb|Both [[Aristotle]] and [[Guanzi (text)|Kuan Tzu]] (4th century BCE), in an example of [[Multiple discovery|simultaneous scientific discovery]], mention that some [[marine animal]]s were subject to a lunar cycle, and increase and decrease in size with the waxing and waning of the moon. Aristotle was referring specifically to the [[sea urchin]], pictured above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1954|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Science in a broad sense existed before the [[modern era]], and in many historical [[civilization]]s, but [[modern science]] is so distinct in its [[Science#Scientific practice|approach]] and successful in its [[science#Literature|results]] that it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The historian ... requires a very broad definition of &quot;science&quot; — one that ... will help us to understand the modern scientific enterprise. We need to be broad and inclusive, rather than narrow and exclusive ... and we should expect that the farther back we go [in time] the broader we will need to be.&quot; — David Pingree (1992), &quot;Hellenophilia versus the History of Science&quot; ''Isis'' '''83''' 554-63, as cited on p.3, [[David C. Lindberg]] (2007), ''The beginnings of Western science: the European Scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context'',  Second ed. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press ISBN 978-0-226-48205-7&lt;/ref&gt; Much earlier than the modern era, another important turning point was the development of the classical [[natural philosophy]] in the ancient Greek-speaking world.

====Pre-philosophical====
Science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge ([[Latin]] ''[[wikt:scientia|scientia]]'', [[Ancient Greek]] ''[[wikt:epistemē|epistemē]]''), rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge. In particular it is one of the types of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thinking, as shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, and buildings such as the pyramids. However no consistent distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems.

====Philosophical study of nature====
{{See also|Nature (philosophy)}}
Before the invention or discovery of the [[concept]] of &quot;[[nature]]&quot; ([[Ancient Greek]] ''phusis''), by the [[Pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, the same words tend to be used to describe the ''natural'' &quot;way&quot; in which a plant grows,&lt;ref&gt;See the quotation in [[Homer]] (8th century BCE) [[Nature#cite note-2|''Odyssey'' 10.302-3]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;way&quot; in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;convention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Progress or Return&quot; in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature, and the things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy&amp;nbsp;— the realm of the first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or [[theory|theorists]], particularly interested in [[astronomy]]. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek ''technē'') was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss and Cropsey eds. History of Political Philosophy, Third edition, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical turn to human things====
A major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by [[Socrates]] to apply philosophy to the study of human things, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. He criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative, and lacking in self-criticism. He was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order, explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter.

The study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition, and Socrates was executed. [[Aristotle]] later created a less controversial systematic programme of Socratic philosophy, which was [[teleological]], and human-centred. He rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists. For example in his physics the sun goes around the earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a [[formal cause]] and [[final cause]] and a role in the rational cosmic order. Motion and change is described as the [[actualization]] of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. While the Socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being, they did not argue for any other types of applied science.

Aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans, treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity, practical thinking about good living as something less lofty, and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes. In contrast to modern science, Aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the &quot;theoretical&quot; steps of [[deductive reasoning|deducing]] universal rules from raw data, and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;... [A] man knows a thing scientifically when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty—for unless he is more certain of his first principles than of the conclusion drawn from them he will only possess the knowledge in question accidentally.&quot;&amp;nbsp;— Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics'' '''6''' (H. Rackham, ed.) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1139b Aristot. Nic. Eth. 1139b]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval science====
During [[late antiquity]] and the [[early Middle Ages]], the Aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomenon was used. Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Roman Empire and periodic political struggles. However, the general fields of science, or [[Natural Philosophy]] as it was called, and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early encyclopedists like [[Isidore of Seville]]. During the early medieval period, Syrian Christians from Eastern Europe such as Nestorians and Monophysites were the ones that translated much of the important [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek science]] texts from Greek to Syriac and the later on they translated many of the works into Arabic and other languages under Islamic rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;history natural philosophy&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Edward|title=A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-68957-1|pages=62–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major line of transmission for the development of [[Islamic science]] which provided much of the activity during the early medieval period. In the later medieval period, Europeans recovered some ancient knowledge by translations of texts and they built their work upon the knowledge of Aristotle, [[Ptolemy]], [[Euclid]], and others works. In Europe, men like [[Roger Bacon]] learned [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]] and argued for more experimental science. By the late Middle Ages, a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as [[Scholasticism]] was flourishing in [[Western Europe]], which had become a new geographic center of science.

====Renaissance, and early modern science====
{{Main|Scientific revolution}}
[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]] is considered one of the fathers of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Galileo and the Birth of Modern Science, by Stephen Hawking, American Heritage's Invention &amp; Technology, Spring 2009, Vol. 24, No. 1, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By the late Middle Ages, especially in Italy there was an influx of texts and scholars from the collapsing [[Byzantine empire]]. [[Copernicus]] formulated a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system unlike the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] [[Almagest]].  All aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries; one author who was notoriously persecuted was [[Galileo]], who made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However the persecution began after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; which caused great offense to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope Urban VIII&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Galileo Project - Pope Urban VIII Biography|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church [[dogma]]. [[René Descartes]] and [[Francis Bacon]] published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature, as Galileo had done, and Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

Bacon questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of &quot;simple&quot; natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or &quot;[[formal cause]]&quot;, of each complex type of thing. This new modern science began to see itself as describing &quot;[[laws of nature]]&quot;. This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as [[mechanistic]].

====Age of Enlightenment====
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the project of modernity, as had been promoted by Bacon and Descartes, led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science, mathematical, methodically experimental, and deliberately innovative. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as [[Newtonian physics]], which could be confirmed by experiment and explained in mathematics. Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example &quot;[[energy]]&quot; and &quot;[[potential]]&quot;. But in the style of Bacon, he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing.

It is, during this period that the word &quot;science&quot; gradually became more commonly used to refer to the pursuit of a type of knowledge, and especially knowledge of nature&amp;nbsp;— coming close in meaning to the old term &quot;[[natural philosophy]]&quot;.

====19th century====
Both [[John Herschel]] and [[William Whewell]] systematised methodology: the latter coined the term [[scientist]]. When [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' he established [[descent with modification]] as the prevailing [[evolution]]ary explanation of biological complexity. His theory of [[natural selection]] provided a natural explanation of how [[species]] originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later. [[John Dalton]] developed the idea of [[atoms]]. The laws of [[Thermodynamics]] and the [[electromagnetic theory]] were also established in the 19th century, which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework.

====20th century and beyond====
[[Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] and the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to the replacement of Newtonian physics with a new physics which contains two parts, that describe different types of events in nature. The extensive use of scientific innovation during the wars of this century, led to the [[space race]] and widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science. More recently it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature- for example in his book ''[[Consilience]]'', [[EO Wilson]] said &quot;The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, EO. 1998. ''Consilience: The unity of knowledge''. New York. Alfred A. Knopf. p334&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Griffith]] supports this view.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith J. 2011. ''What is Science?''. In ''The Book of Real Answers to Everything!'', ISBN 9781741290073. http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-science/ accessed November 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of science===
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
{{further|Intersubjective verifiability|Subjunctive possibility}}
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Locke]]
Working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation.  Philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.

The belief that all observers share a common reality is known as [[Scientific realism|realism]].  It can be contrasted with [[anti-realism]], the belief that there is no valid concept of absolute truth such that things that are true for one observer are true for all observers.  The most commonly defended form of anti-realism is [[idealism]], the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality.&lt;ref&gt;This realization is the topic of [[intersubjective verifiability]], as recounted, for example, by [[Max Born]] (1949, 1965) [http://www.archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp/naturalphilosoph032159mbp_djvu.txt ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance''], who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. Page 162: &quot;Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  In an idealistic world-view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

There are different schools of thought in philosophy of science. The most popular position is [[empiricism]], which claims that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...[T]he logical empiricists thought that the great aim of science was to discover and establish ''generalizations''.&quot;&amp;nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empiricism generally encompasses [[inductivism]], a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and the hence finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using [[deductive logic]] only. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being [[bayesianism]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bayesianism tries to understand evidence using probability theory.&quot;&amp;nbsp;—{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[hypothetico-deductive method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Distinguished men of science of Great Britain 1806-7|align=right|size=400px}}
Empiricism has stood in contrast to [[rationalism]], the position originally associated with [[Descartes]], which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant 20th-century version of rationalism is [[critical rationalism]], first defined by Austrian-British philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=63–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper proposed [[falsifiability]] as the landmark of scientific theories, and [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsification]] as the empirical method, to replace verifiability&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and induction by purely deductive notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, and that this method is not specific to science: The negative method of criticism, [[trial and error]].&lt;ref&gt;Popper called this ''Conjecture and Refutation'' {{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|pp=117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art &lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper: ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach, [[instrumentalism]], colloquially termed &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;, emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rationality of Science | author = Newton-Smith, W. H. | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1994 | page = 30|isbn = 0-7100-0913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that scientific theories are black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, notions and logical structure of the theories are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about (see [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]).

[[Paul K Feyerabend]] advanced the idea of [[epistemological anarchism]], which holds that there are no useful and exception-free [[methodology|methodological rules]] governing the [[scientific progress|progress of science]] or the growth of [[knowledge]], and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic, pernicious and detrimental to science itself.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend advocates treating science as an [[ideology]] alongside others such as [[religion]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mythology]], and considers the dominance of science in society [[authoritarian]] and unjustified. He also contended (along with [[Imre Lakatos]]) that the [[demarcation problem]] of distinguishing science from [[pseudoscience]] on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed, universal rules.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} Feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts, particularly the notion of [[Uniformitarianism|Uniformity of Law and the Uniformity of Process across time and space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 0-86091-184-5 | title = Farewell To Reason| page = 100 | publisher = Verso | last = Feyerabend | first = Paul | year = 1987 | authorlink = Paul Feyerabend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of [[scientific skepticism]] against controversial movements like &quot;[[scientific creationism]]&quot;, is [[methodological naturalism]]. Its main point is that a difference between natural and [[supernatural]] explanations should be made, and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Godfrey-Smith|2003|p=151}} credits [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1969) &quot;Epistemology Naturalized&quot; ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'' New York: Columbia University Press, as well as [[John Dewey]], with the basic ideas of naturalism&amp;nbsp;— [[Naturalized Epistemology]], but Godfrey-Smith diverges from Quine's position: according to Godfrey-Smith, &quot;A naturalist can think that science can contribute to ''answers'' to philosophical questions, without thinking that philosophical questions can be replaced by science questions.&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to [[empirical]] study and [[independent verification]] as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for [[observation|observable]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = The Review of Metaphysics|title = Casebeer, William D. Natural Ethical Facts: Evolution, Connectionism, and Moral Cognition|author = Brugger, E. Christian|volume = 58| issue = 2|year = 2004|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of these standards, [[Appeal to authority|arguments from authority]], biased [[observational studies]] and other common [[fallacy|fallacies]] are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as criteria for the dubious claims they criticize not to be true science.

[[File:DNA Overview2.png|thumb|right|upright|[[DNA]] determines the genetic structure of all known life]]

====Certainty and science====
A scientific theory is [[empirical]], and is always open to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever considered strictly [[Certainty|certain]] as science accepts the concept of [[fallibilism]]. The philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] sharply distinguishes truth from certainty. He writes that scientific knowledge &quot;consists in the search for truth&quot;, but it &quot;is not the search for certainty ... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain.&quot;{{sfn|Popper|1996|p=4}}

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding. According to psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]], it may be the media's overuse of words like &quot;breakthrough&quot; that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}} pg 119–138&lt;/ref&gt; While there are such famous cases as the [[theory of relativity]] that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments, by various researchers, across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}} pg 123&lt;/ref&gt; Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|authorlink=Ludwik Fleck|editor1-first=Thaddeus J. |editor1-last=Trenn|editor2-first=Robert K |editor2-last=Merton|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-25325-2}} Claims that before a specific fact &quot;existed&quot;, it had to be created as part of a social agreement within a community. [[Steven Shapin]] (1980) &quot;A view of scientific thought&quot; ''Science'' ccvii (7 Mar 1980) 1065-66 states &quot;[To Fleck,] facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction: a ''made'' thing. &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], [[evolution|the theory of evolution]], [[relativity theory]], and [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] still bear the name &quot;theory&quot; even though, in practice, they are considered [[fact]]ual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2005/sep/01/schools.research | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=One side can be wrong | first1=Richard | last1=Dawkins | first2=Jerry | last2=Coyne | date=2005-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Philosopher [[Barry Stroud]] adds that, although the best definition for &quot;[[knowledge]]&quot; is contested, being [[skeptical]] and entertaining the ''possibility'' that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct. Ironically then, the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html |title=Barry Stroud on Scepticism |publisher=philosophy bites |date=2007-12-16 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fallibilist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.&amp;nbsp;S. Peirce]] argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or [[hyperbolic doubt]] is fruitless&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1877), &quot;The Fixation of Belief&quot;, Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 1–15, see §IV on [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6–7]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 358–87 (see 374–6), ''Writings'' v. 3, pp. 242–57 (see 247–8), ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 109–23 (see 114–15), and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;—but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905), &quot;Issues of Pragmaticism&quot;, ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99, see &quot;Character V&quot; on [http://www.archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 438–63 (see 451), ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 346–59 (see 353), and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the successful sciences trust, not to any single chain of inference (no stronger than its weakest link), but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1868), &quot;Some Consequences of Four Incapacities&quot;, ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA141 p. 141]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'', v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''Writings'' v. 2, pp. 211–42, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a &quot;magic bullet&quot;; it avoids the [[Fallacy of the single cause|single-cause fallacy]]. This means a scientist would not ask merely &quot;What is ''the'' cause of...&quot;, but rather &quot;What ''are'' the most significant ''causes'' of...&quot;. This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science (e.g. [[psychology]], [[cosmology]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanovich, 2007, pp 141–147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007}} pp 141–147&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanovich, 2007, pp 141–147&quot;/&gt; For example: knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behaviour, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive.

===Pseudoscience, fringe science, and junk science===
{{Main| Pseudoscience|Fringe science|Junk science|Cargo cult science|Scientific misconduct}}

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as [[pseudoscience]], [[fringe science]], or &quot;alternative science&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Pseudoscientific&amp;nbsp;— pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''&quot;, from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; Hansson, Sven Ove (1996).&quot;Defining Pseudoscience&quot;, Philosophia Naturalis, 33: 169–176, as cited in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/#NonSciPosSci &quot;Science and Pseudo-science&quot;] (2008) in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Stanford article states: &quot;Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), &quot;[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.&quot; These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific&quot;.

Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] coined the term &quot;[[cargo cult science]]&quot; in reference to pursuits that have the formal trappings of science but lack &quot;a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty&quot; that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;ref name='cargocultscience'&gt;[http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html Cargo Cult Science] by [[Richard Feynman|Feyman, Richard]].

There also can be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of such debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as &quot;bad science&quot;, research that is well-intentioned but is seen as incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term &quot;[[scientific misconduct]]&quot; refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;cite id=&quot;COPE1999PDF&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coping with fraud |work=The COPE Report 1999 |pages=11–18 |url=http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928151119/http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/reports/1999/1999pdf3.pdf |quote=It is 10 years, to the month, since Stephen Lock ...

A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken as early as 1000 years ago, with [[Alhazen]], ''[[Critique of Ptolemy|Doubts Concerning Ptolemy]]'', through Bacon (1605), and [[C. S. Peirce]] (1839–1914), who note that a [[#Scientific community|community]] will then spring up to address these points of uncertainty.  The methods of [[Method of Elenchus#Method|inquiry]] into a problem have been known for thousands of years,&lt;ref&gt;In mathematics, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno#Dialogue with Meno's slave|Meno]]'' demonstrates that it is possible to know logical propositions, such as the [[Pythagorean theorem]], and even to prove them, as cited by  {{harvnb|Crease|2009|pp=35–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of [[measurement]]s, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.

[[John Ziman]] points out that [[intersubjective verifiability|intersubjective pattern recognition]] is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Ziman cites {{harvnb|Polanyi|1958}} chapter 12, as referenced in {{harvnb|Ziman|1978|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziman shows how scientists can identify  patterns to each other across centuries: {{harvnb|Needham|1954}} (illustration facing page 164) shows how today's trained Western botanist can identify ''[[Artemisia absinthium|Artemisia alba]]'' from images taken from a 16th-century Chinese pharmacopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ziman refers to this ability as 'perceptual consensibility'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziman then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziman|1978|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific method]] seeks to explain the events of [[nature]] in a [[reproducible]] way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|p=13}}: &quot;The amazing point is that for the first time since the discovery of mathematics, a method has been introduced, the results of which have an intersubjective value!&quot; ''(Author's punctuation)''&lt;/ref&gt; An explanatory [[thought experiment]] or [[hypothesis]] is put forward, as explanation, using principles such as [[parsimony]] (also known as &quot;[[Occam's Razor]]&quot;) and are generally expected to seek [[consilience]]—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Wilson | first = Edward | title = Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge | publisher = Vintage | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-679-76867-X| ref = harv| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; This new explanation is used to make [[falsifiable]] predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|di Francia|1976|pp=4–5}}: &quot;One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments&amp;nbsp;— each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fara|2009|p=204}}: &quot;Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that ... distinguished them from non-scientists.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation, that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions, as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish [[causality|causal relationships]] (to avoid the [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation fallacy]]). 

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|p=208}} If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a [[theory (science)|scientific theory]]. This is a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing hypotheses, scientists may also generate a [[Scientific modeling|model]] based on observed phenomena. This is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested.{{sfn|Nola|Irzik|2005|pp=199–201}} 

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=van Gelder | first=Tim | year=1999  | url=http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/tgelder/papers/HeadsIWin.pdf | format=PDF  | title=&quot;Heads I win, tails you lose&quot;: A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy | publisher=University of Melbourne

===Mathematics and formal sciences===
{{Main|Mathematics}}
[[File:Michelsonmorley-boxplot.svg|thumb|300px|Data from the famous [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]]]
[[Mathematics]] is essential to the sciences. One important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models. Observing and collecting [[measurements]], as well as hypothesizing and predicting, often require extensive use of mathematics. [[Arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]] and [[calculus]], for example, are all essential to [[physics]]. Virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science, including &quot;pure&quot; areas such as [[number theory]] and [[topology]].

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]], which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data, allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results. Statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences.

[[Computational science]] applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. According to the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]], computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siam.org/students/resources/report.php Graduate Education for Computational Science and Engineering], SIAM Working Group on CSE Education. Retrieved 2008-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate. Some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists, regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments. Others do not see mathematics as a science, since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses. Mathematical [[theorem]]s and [[formula]]s are obtained by [[Mathematical logic|logical]] derivations which presume [[axiom]]atic systems, rather than the combination of [[empirical]] observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the [[scientific method]]. In general, mathematics is classified as [[formal science]], while natural and social sciences are classified as [[empirical]] sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory | author = Bunge, Mario Augusto | year = 1998 | publisher = Transaction Publishers | isbn = 0-7658-0413-1 | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic and applied research===
Although some scientific research is [[applied research]] into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of [[basic research]]. This leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when, allegedly in response to the question &quot;what is the ''use'' of basic research?&quot; he responded &quot;Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/91 |title=To Live at All Is Miracle Enough&amp;nbsp;— Richard Dawkins |publisher=RichardDawkins.net |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's [[rod cells]] did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our [[night vision]] is not troubled by red light would lead [[search and rescue]] teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanovich|2007|pp= 106–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a nutshell: Basic research is the search for knowledge. Applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to [[Scientific method#Luck and science|harness luck]].

===Research in practice===
Due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals.&lt;ref name=simonton2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|title=After Einstein: Scientific genius is extinct|journal=Nature|volume=493|issue=7434|pages=602–602|doi=10.1038/493602a}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked. Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.&lt;ref name=simonton2013/&gt;

=== Practical impacts of scientific research ===
Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing, but often take time to have that effect. For example:

{{Main|Scientific community}}

The scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists. It includes many sub-communities working on particular scientific fields, and within particular institutions; interdisciplinary and cross-institutional activities are also significant.

===Branches and fields===
{{Main|Branches of science}}
&lt;!-- The organizational tables have been moved to the main article &quot;Fields of science&quot; --&gt;

Scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups: [[natural science]]s, which study natural phenomena (including [[Biology|biological life]]), and [[social science]]s, which study [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]]. These groupings are [[empirical]] sciences, which means the knowledge must be based on observable [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} There are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary and applied sciences, such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own [[nomenclature]] and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematics]], which is classified as a [[formal science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB |title=Marcus Tomalin (2006) '&amp;#39;Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'&amp;#39; |doi=10.2277/0521854814 |publisher=Cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt Löwe (2002) [http://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 &quot;The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10–11}} The formal sciences, which also include [[statistics]] and [[logic]], are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential in the formation of [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Theory|theories]], and [[physical law|laws]],{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79–82}} both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people think and act (social sciences).

===Institutions===
[[File:Académie des Sciences 1671.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis XIV]] visiting the {{lang|fr|[[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]]}} in 1671]]
[[Learned society|Learned societies]] for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Parrott | first=Jim | date=August 9, 2007 | url=http://www.scholarly-societies.org/1599andearlier.html | title=Chronicle for Societies Founded from 1323 to 1599 | publisher=Scholarly Societies Project | accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving institution is the Italian {{lang|it|''[[Accademia dei Lincei]]''}} which was established in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006 | url=http://positivamente.lincei.it/ | title=Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei | language=Italian | accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The respective National [[Academy of Sciences|Academies of Science]] are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries, beginning with the British [[Royal Society]] in 1660&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/ | title= History of the Royal Society | publisher=The Royal Society | accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the French {{lang|fr|''[[Académie des Sciences]]''}} in 1666.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=G.G. | last=Meynell | url=http://www.haven.u-net.com/6text_7B2.htm#Appendix%202 | title=The French Academy of Sciences, 1666–91: A reassessment of the French Académie royale des sciences under Colbert (1666–83) and Louvois (1683–91) | publisher= | accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International scientific organizations, such as the [[International Council for Science]], have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include, the [[National Science Foundation]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[CONICET|National Scientific and Technical Research Council]] in Argentina, the [[academy of sciences|academies of science]] of many nations, [[CSIRO]] in Australia, {{lang|fr|[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]}} in France, [[Max Planck Society]] and {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]}} in Germany, and in Spain, [[CSIC]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Scientific literature}}

An enormous range of [[scientific literature]] is published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |authorlink=John Ziman| last=Ziman | first=J.M. | journal=Science
 | title=The proliferation of scientific literature: a natural process | year=1980 | volume=208 | issue=4442 | pages=369–371 | doi= 10.1126/science.7367863 | pmid=7367863 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific journal]]s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, ''[[Journal des Sçavans]]'' followed by the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. As of 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Krishna | last=Subramanyam | coauthors=Subramanyam, Bhadriraju | year=1981 | title=Scientific and Technical Information Resources | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=0-8247-8297-6 | oclc=232950234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States National Library of Medicine]] currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39 languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

[[Science magazine]]s such as ''[[NewScientist|New Scientist]]'', ''[[Science &amp; Vie]]'', and ''[[Scientific American]]'' cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. [[Science book]]s engage the interest of many more people. Tangentially, the [[science fiction]] genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as [[Literature]] or, more specifically, [[Poetry]], include the ''Creative Writing Science'' resource developed through the [[Royal Literary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Mario | last=Petrucci | url=http://writeideas.org.uk/creativescience/index.htm | title=Creative Writing &lt;-&gt; Science | accessdate=2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in science===
{{Main|Women in science}}
[[File:Rubin vera f1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vera Rubin]], the first astronomer to infer galactic clumping from astronomical data in 1953, was not allowed to use the telescope at Palomar until 1965, with the given reason that the facility did not have a women's [[restroom]].]]

Science is largely a male-dominated field, with notable exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Women in science have included:
*[[Hypatia]] (c. 350-415 CE), of the Library of Alexandria.
*[[Trotula]] of Salerno, a physician c. 1060 CE.
*[[Caroline Herschel]] one of the first professional astronomers of the 18th and 19th centuries.
*[[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], a doctoral student of C. S. Peirce, who published Wittgenstein's proposition 5.101 in her dissertation, 40 years before Wittgenstein's publication of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].
*[[Henrietta Leavitt]], a professional human computer and astronomer, who first published the significant relationship between the luminosity of [[Cepheid variable]] stars and their distance from Earth. This allowed Hubble to make the discovery of the expanding universe, which led to the Big Bang theory.
*[[Emmy Noether]], who proved the [[conservation of energy]] and other [[constants of motion]] in 1915.
*[[Nina Byers]] notes that after 1976, women in science became much more prevalent in science, than the exceptions&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority of male scientists are the ones who have made the discoveries, written the books and thus have written the rules of what to study and how to study it. There is evidence suggesting that this is a product of stereotypes (e.g. science as &quot;manly&quot;) as well as [[Self fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Summers|Summers, L. H.]] (2005). Remarks at NBER Conference on Diversifying the Science &amp; Engineering Workforce. The office of the President. Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek, B.A., et al. (2009). National differences in gender–science stereotypes predict national sex differences in science and math achievement. PNAS, June 30, 2009, 106, 10593–10597.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls, asking them to reflect more deeply and logically.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, K. Callanan, M.A., Tenenbaum, H. R., &amp; Allen, E. (2001). Parents explain more often to boys than to girls during shared scientific thinking. Psychological Science, 258–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Evelyn Fox Keller]] argues that science has [[Masculinity#Development|masculine]] stereotypes causing ego and competitiveness to obstruct progress, and that these tendencies prevent collaboration and sharing of information.&lt;ref&gt;Reflections on Gender and Science. Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have faced a lot of discrimination getting not only credit for their scientific discoveries but also getting opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nina Byers]],[http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/ Contributions of 20th Century Women to Physics] which details and 83 female physicists of the 20th century, By 1976, more women were physicists, and the 83 who were detailed were joined by other women in noticeably larger numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; Both in research and professorship the quantity of females are very limited in comparison to their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Londa Schiebinger 1999&quot;&gt;Londa Schiebinger, Has Feminism Changed Science (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of females in science can be directly associated with the social atmosphere which has always treated science as a more masculine area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Londa Schiebinger, Has Feminism Changed Science (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with boys being pushed more towards academia and girls being confined to the domestic sphere, females have faced both discrimination and difficulty entering into science. Those who are a part of the scientific community find it difficult to break the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; which thus limits how far they can advance within the field. The barrier between work and home has also been an obstacle that women have had to overcome to succeed in the sciences. The achievements of women in science are attributed to their defiance of traditional status of being a laborer within the domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Spanier, From Molecules to Brains, Normal Science Supports Sexist Beliefs About Differences, The Gender and Science Reader ( New York: Routledge 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist authors and leaders who hail from various educational backgrounds such as [[Londa Schiebinger]], [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], [[Bonnie Spanier]], and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]]&lt;ref&gt;The Gender and Science Reader&lt;/ref&gt; have published many works interpreting and critiquing science from a feminist perspective. Some criticisms include the gendered metaphors in science, the lack of representation of females in the sciences, how science is used to back up the ideals of patriarchy, and sex/gender dichotomies. [[Feminist Science Studies]] as a sub-genre of [[Women's Studies]] or [[Gender Studies]] are available as areas of study in many universities as a method of activism to promote and encourage awareness of social issues as well as promoting women and intersex individuals to contribute more to the sciences.

Although it has been difficult for women to break into the field of science as credible contributors, many new discoveries have been a result of work by female scientists. Some of the most famous females in the field include [[Marie Curie]], who made discoveries relating to radioactivity, [[Rosalind Franklin]], who worked with x-ray diffraction, [[Caroline Herschel]], who was the first woman to be paid for her scientific work and [[Jane Goodall]], who is currently the world's foremost primatologist.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Zielinski, Ten Historic Female Scientists You Should Know, web.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Ten-Historic-Female-Scientists-You-Should-Know.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These women helped establish a place for women in a heavily male dominated field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Londa Schiebinger 1999&quot;/&gt; 
Most female scientists have only gained fame and authority in the 20th century although there have been advancements in the natural sciences made by women since the early 15th century. [[Christine de Pizan]] wrote the first encyclopedia in which she gave credit to these 15th-century women for the scientific discoveries of bread making, wool dyeing, grain cultivation and many other day to day inventions.

===Science policy===
{{Main|Science policy|History of science policy|Funding of science|Economics of science}}
[[File:Clinton&amp;1998NobelLaureates.jpg|thumb|240px|President Clinton meets the 1998 U.S. [[Nobel Prize]] winners in the White House.]] 
Science policy is an area of [[public policy]] concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including [[research funding]], often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.  Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.  Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.  In accordance with [[public policy]] being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

[[State (polity)|State]] [[policy]] has influenced the funding of [[public works]] and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the [[Mohists]], who inspired the study of logic during the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]], and the study of defensive fortifications during the [[Warring States Period]] in China. In [[Great Britain]], governmental approval of [[the Royal Society]] in the 17th century recognized a [[scientific community]] which exists to this day.  The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], and State funding of universities of their respective nations.  Public policy can directly affect the funding of [[capital equipment]], intellectual infrastructure for industrial research, by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research. [[Vannevar Bush]], director of the office of scientific research and development for the United States government, the forerunner of the [[National Science Foundation]], wrote in July 1945 that &quot;Science is a proper concern of government&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm |title=Vannevar Bush (July 1945), &quot;Science, the Endless Frontier&quot; |publisher=Nsf.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science and technology]] research is often funded through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most [[developed country|developed countries]] is between 1.5% and 3% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5tamBWVvW |format=pdf |title=Main Science and Technology Indicators - 2008-1 |publisher=OECD |accessdate=20 April 2012}} 50.8&amp;nbsp;KB&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[OECD]], around two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government.  The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for [[Basic science|basic scientific research]].  In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than &quot;[[Blue skies research|blue-sky]]&quot; ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).

===Media perspectives===
The [[mass media]] face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a [[scientific debate]] may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Political usage===
{{see also|Politicization of science}}

Many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by [[politician]]s. As a very broad generalisation, many politicians seek certainties and ''facts'' whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats. However, politicians' ability to be heard in the [[mass media]] frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public. Examples in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] include the controversy over the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] [[inoculation]], and the 1988 forced resignation of a Government Minister, [[Edwina Currie]] for revealing the high probability that [[Battery cage|battery]] farmed eggs were contaminated with ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_2519000/2519451.stm &quot;1988: Egg industry fury over salmonella claim&quot;], &quot;On This Day,&quot; BBC News, December 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]], [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]], and researchers from the US and Canada have described Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs), where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas.&lt;ref name=DoubtIs&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/wjh13f00|title=Original &quot;Doubt is our product...&quot; memo|date=21 August 1969|publisher=University of California, San Francisco|accessdate=3 October 2012}} The memo reads &quot;Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HorganReview&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/books/review/18horgan.html?pagewanted=all &quot;'THE REPUBLICAN WAR ON SCIENCE,' BY CHRIS MOONEY&quot;, Political Science, Review by JOHN HORGAN, Published: December 18 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Mooney, Chris]]| title = The Republican War on Science| publisher = [[Basic Books]]| year = 2005| isbn = 0-465-04676-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SCAMs&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-682X.2008.00219.x/abstract William R.
