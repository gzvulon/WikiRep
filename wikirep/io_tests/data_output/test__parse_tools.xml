The '''Ross Ice Shelf''' is the largest  of  (an area of roughly  and about  across: about the size of France).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/teacher_resources/information/faqs/hazards.php Antarctic Hazards - British Antarctic Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; It is several hundred metres thick. The nearly vertical ice front to the open sea is more than  long, and between  high above the water surface. Ninety percent of the floating ice, however, is below the water surface.
Most of Ross Ice Shelf is in the  claimed by New Zealand. 
The ice shelf was named after Captain Sir , who discovered it on 28 January 1841. It was originally named the ''Victoria barrier'' by Ross after  and later the ''Great Ice Barrier'', as it prevented sailing further south. Ross mapped the ice front eastward to 160&#176;W. 
On  January 5, 1841, a British Admiralty team in the '''' and the '''', three- ships with specially strengthened wooden , was going through the pack ice of the Pacific near Antarctica in an attempt to determine the position of the South Magnetic Pole. Four days later, they found their way into open water and were hoping that they would have a clear passage to their destination. But on 11 January, the men were faced with an enormous mass of ice.
Sir , who was the expedition's commander, remarked: "Well, there's no more chance of sailing through that than through the cliffs of Dover". Ross, who in 1831 had located the , spent the next two years vainly searching for a sea passage to the South Pole; later, his name was given to the ice shelf and the sea surrounding it. Two volcanoes in the region were named by Ross for his vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_bas/publications/bas_ships.pdf Antarctica.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;
For early  seeking to reach the South Pole, the Ross Ice Shelf became a starting area. In a first exploration of the area,  made a significant study of the shelf and its surroundings from his expedition's base on . These findings were presented at a lecture entitled "Universitas Antarctica!" given 7 June 1911 and were published in the account of Scott's expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert and Leonard Huxley. ''Scott's Last Expedition in Two Volumes: Vol. II.'' New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Both  and Scott crossed the shelf to reach the Pole in 1911. Amundsen wrote: "Along its outer edge the Barrier shows an even, flat surface; but here, inside the bay, the conditions were entirely different. Even from the deck of the '''' we were able to observe great disturbances of the surface in every direction; huge ridges with hollows between them extended on all sides. The greatest elevation lay to the south in the form of a lofty, arched ridge, which we took to be about 500 feet high on the horizon. But it might be assumed that this ridge continued to rise beyond the range of vision".
The next day, the party made its first steps on the Barrier. "After half an hour&#8217;s march we were already at the first important pointthe connection between the sea-ice and the Barrier. This connection had always haunted our brains. What would it be like? A high, perpendicular face of ice, up which we should have to haul our things laboriously with the help of tackles? Or a great and dangerous fissure, which we should not be able to cross without going a long way round? We naturally expected something of the sort. This mighty and terrible monster would, of course, offer resistance in some form or other," he wrote.
"The mystic Barrier! All accounts without exception, from the days of Ross to the present time, had spoken of this remarkable natural formation with apprehensive awe. It was as though one could always read between the lines the same sentence: 'Hush, be quiet! the mystic Barrier!'
"One, two, three, and a little jump, and the Barrier was surmounted!"&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, Roald (Translated from the Norwegian by A. G. Chater). ''The South Pole An Account of the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition in the 'Fram,' 1910&#8211;1912'', eBooks@Adelaide, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ice shelves are thick plates of ice, formed continuously by glaciers, that float atop an ocean. The presence of the shelves acts as "brakes" for the glaciers. These shelves serve another important purpose -- "they moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers' surfaces. Once their ice shelves are removed, the glaciers increase in speed due to meltwater percolation and/or a reduction of braking forces, and they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments. Glacier ice speed increases are already observed in Peninsula areas where ice shelves disintegrated in prior years."&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;[http://nsidc.org/news/press/larsen_B/2002.html Larsen B Ice Shelf Collapses in Antarctica, March 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ross Ice Shelf is one of many such shelves. It is about the size of France,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; and reaches into Antarctica from the north. The ice mass is about  wide and 970km (600miles) long. In some places, namely its southern areas, the ice shelf can be almost 750m (2,450ft) thick. The Ross Ice Shelf pushes out into the sea at the rate of between  a day. There are other  that gradually add bulk to it. At the same time, the  of seawater below the ice mass increases the thickness of the ice from . Sometimes,  and cracks may cause part of the shelf to break off; the largest known is about , that is, slightly larger than the size of Belgium. , the world's largest recorded , was calved from the Ross Ice Shelf during March 2000.
Scientists have long been intrigued by the shelf and its composition. 
In fact, most of the scientific teams have made camps on or adjacent to the Ross Ice Shelf. This includes .&lt;ref name="trisp"/&gt;  One major effort was a series of studies conducted in 1957 and 1958, which were continued during the 1960&#8211;61 season. The efforts involved an international team of scientists. Some parties explored the glaciers and others the valleys on the ice shelf.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
From 1967 to 1972 the  reported extensive observations using . The technique allowed measurements to be taken from the air; allowing a criss cross track of 35,000km to be covered; compared with a 3,000km track from previous seismic sounding on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature-Times News Service''; '''Science report Glaciology: Ross ice shelf flow'''; ; 28 Jan 1975; p.12&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed surveys were executed between 1973 and 1978.
A significant scientific endeavor called the Ross Ice Shelf Project was launched with a plan of drilling into the shelf to sample the biomass in the area and make other determinations about the shelf and its relationship to the sea floor. The Project included surface glaciological observations as well as drilling, and the glaciological portion started during the planning phase of the drilling.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The drilling portion of the project was to have begun during 1974, but the actual drilling was delayed until 1976. Finally, in 1977, the scientists were able to drill successfully through the ice, making a hole that could be sampled every few days for three weeks. The team was able to map the sea floor, study the tides, and assess the fish and various other forms of life in the waters. The team also examined the oceanographic and geological conditions as well as the temperature of the ice. They estimated that the base of the shelf was &#8722;2.16&#176; Celsius (27.3&#176;F). They also made other calculations about the fluctuations of the temperatures.&lt;ref name="trisp"/&gt;
 
The results of these various projects are published in a series of reports in ''Science'' magazine, published 2 February 1979.&lt;ref name="trisp"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 1980s, a network of weather stations were installed to record temperatures on the shelf as well as throughout the more remote parts of the continent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
University of Colorado's  has been studying ice shelves and, in 2002, announced that, based on several break ups of ice shelves, including Larsen B, has begun to reassess their stability. Their scientists stated that the temperature of the warmest portion of the shelf is "only a few degrees too cool in summer presently to undergo the same kind of retreat process. The Ross Ice Shelf is the main outlet for several major glaciers draining the , which contains the equivalent of 5 m of  in its above-sea-level ice." The report added that observations of "iceberg " on the Ross Ice Shelf are, in their opinion, unrelated to its stability.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;
 
Continuing scientific exploration continues to uncover interesting information and the analyses have resulted in some interesting theories being posited and publicized. One such opinion, given in 2006 based on a geological survey, suggested that the ice shelf had collapsed previously, perhaps suddenly, which could well happen again.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="18798090" rev_id="517822235" title="Southern Cross Expedition">
The '''Southern Cross Expedition''', officially known as the '''British Antarctic Expedition 1898&#8211;1900''', which was the first British venture of the , and the forerunner of the more celebrated journeys of  and . The brainchild of the Norwegian-born, half-British explorer and schoolmaster , it was the first expedition to over-winter on the Antarctic mainland, the first to visit the  since  in 1839&#8211;43, and the first to effect a landing on the Barrier's surface. It also pioneered the use of dogs and sledges in Antarctic travel.
The expedition was privately financed by the British magazine publisher . Taken south in the ship  in August 1898, Borchgrevink's party spent the winter of 1899 at , the north-west extremity of the  coastline. Here they carried out an extensive programme of scientific observations, although opportunities for inland exploration were severely restricted by the mountainous and glaciated terrain surrounding the base. In January 1900 the party left Cape Adare in ''Southern Cross'' to explore the Ross Sea, following the route taken by Ross sixty years earlier. They reached the Great Ice Barrier, where a team of three made the first ge journey on the Barrier surface, during which a new  record latitude was established at 78&#176;50&#8242;S.
On its return to England the expedition was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption of a role they envisaged for their own . There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, , conqueror of the  in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had opened the way for all the expeditions that followed.
Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian father and an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, where he worked on survey teams in the interior before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in .&lt;ref name=adb&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by  in the whaler ''Antarctic'', which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the . A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and claimed to be the first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent&#8212;although the American sealer  believed he had landed on the  in 1821.&lt;ref name=ForgottenEx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also visited  in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3&gt; p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge  providing a ready supply of fresh food and , could serve as a base at which a future expedition could  and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-intro&gt; (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Preston14&gt;Preston, pp. 14&#8211;16&lt;/ref&gt;
Determined that he would lead such an expedition himself, after his return from Cape Adare Borchgrevink spent much of the next three years attempting to gain financial backing in Australia and England. Despite some encouragement from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), whose International Congress he addressed in 1895, he was initially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=SouthPole1&gt; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The RGS was in fact harbouring plans of its own for a large-scale National Antarctic Expedition&lt;ref&gt;This would in due course become the , led by Captain Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in search of funds; Borchgrevink was regarded by RGS president  as a foreign interloper and a rival for funding.&lt;ref name=Preston14/&gt; However, Borchgrevink eventually managed to persuade publisher Sir  (whose business rival  was backing Markham's venture) to meet the full cost of his expedition, some &#163;40,000 (approximately &#163; as of ).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This gift infuriated Markham and the RGS, since Newnes's donation, had it come their way, would have been enough "to get the National Expedition on its legs".&lt;ref name=SouthPole2&gt; p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
Newnes made one stipulation: Borchgrevink's expedition must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though only two of the entire expedition party were British.&lt;ref name=Jones59&gt;Jones, pp. 59&#8211;60. Another member of the shore party, , was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham,&lt;ref name=Crane74&gt;Crane, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; who chastised RGS librarian  for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.&lt;ref name= Jones59/&gt;
There, Mill had toasted the success of the expedition in stirring terms, calling it "a reproach to human enterprise" that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through "the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink".&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Borchgrevink's expedition objectives comprised commercial, scientific and geographical goals. He considered forming a company to exploit the extensive  deposits that he had observed during his 1894&#8211;95 voyage, but this came to nothing.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-intro/&gt; In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could be carried out by a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the .&lt;ref name=SouthPole1/&gt; The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines&#8212;, , , ,  and .&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-people&gt;Equipment and Personnel&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical  itself.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-intro/&gt; With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.&lt;ref name=ForgottenExpedition&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crane, pp. 74&#8211;75&lt;/ref&gt;
For his expedition's ship, Borchgrevink purchased a steam whaler, ''Pollux'', that had been built in the yard of , the renowned Norwegian shipbuilder.&lt;ref name=Borch10&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Archer had designed and built  ship '''', which in 1896 had returned unscathed from its long drift in the northern polar ocean during Nansen's "Farthest North" expedition, 1893&#8211;96.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pollux'', which Borchgrevink immediately renamed ''Southern Cross'',&lt;ref name=ForgottenExpedition/&gt; was , 520tons , and  overall length.&lt;ref name=Borch10/&gt; Engines were designed to Borchgrevink's specification, and fitted before the ship left Norway.&lt;ref name= Borch10/&gt; Although Markham cast doubts on her seaworthiness (perhaps to thwart Borchgrevink's departure),&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 16"&gt;Preston, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; the ship fulfilled all that was required of her in Antarctic waters. Like several of the historic polar ships her post-expedition life was short;&lt;ref&gt; Fate of ''Nimrod'' and ''Aurora''&lt;/ref&gt; she was sold to the Newfoundland Sealing Company, and in April 1914 was lost with all hands in a storm off the Newfoundland coast.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;
The shore party of ten who were to winter at Cape Adare consisted of Borchgrevink, five scientists, a medical officer, a cook who also served as a general assistant, and two dog drivers. Of this party, five were Norwegians, two were English, one was Australian and two, the dog experts, were  from Northern Norway, sometimes described in expedition accounts as s or "Finns".&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt;&lt;ref name="anta-canterbury-people"/&gt; Among the scientists was the Tasmanian , who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the . He had been appointed to the , 1897&#8211;99, but had been unable to take up his post; the expedition's ship, '''', had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south, leaving Bernacchi stranded.&lt;ref name=Borch13/&gt; Bernacchi then travelled to London and secured a place on Borchgrevink's scientific staff.&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; His chronicle of the Southern Cross Expedition, which was published in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;''To the South Polar Regions'', Hurst &amp; Blackett, London 1901&lt;/ref&gt; was critical of aspects of Borchgrevink's leadership, but defended the expedition's scientific achievements.&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt; In 1901 Bernacchi went back to Antarctica as a physicist on  Scott's ''Discovery'' Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borchgrevink's men who was to serve Scott's expedition (in command of ''Discovery'''s relief ship ''Morning'') was Englishman ,&lt;ref&gt;Crane, pp. 232&#8211;33&lt;/ref&gt; an experienced seaman who held a 's commission in the .&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; In preparation for the Southern Cross Expedition Colbeck had taken a course in magnetism at .&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt;
Borchgrevink's assistant zoologist was Hugh Blackwell Evans, a vicar's son from , who had spent three years on a cattle ranch in Canada and had also been on a  voyage to the .&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt; The chief zoologist was , a graduate from the . Also in the shore party was Herlof Klovstad, the expedition's medical officer, whose previous appointment had been to a lunatic asylum in .&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; The others were Anton Fougner, scientific assistant and general handyman; Kolbein Ellifsen, cook and general assistant; and the two Sami dog-handlers, Per Savio and Ole Must.&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt; Savio and Must, at 21 and 20 years of age respectively, were the youngest of the party.&lt;ref name=ForgottenEx/&gt; Borchgrevink later described Savio as "well-known for his faithful character, hardihood and intelligence".&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt;
The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, consisted of 19Norwegian seamen and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and Antarctic waters, and had been with Borchgrevink on Bull's ''Antarctic'' voyage in 1894&#8211;95.&lt;ref name=Borch13&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
''Southern Cross'' left London on 23 August 1898, after inspection by  (the future King George V), who presented a .&lt;ref name="Borch6" /&gt; Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions the ship was carrying Siberian sledge dogs, the first to be taken on an Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-equip&gt; (Equipment and Personnel)&lt;/ref&gt; After final provisioning in , , ''Southern Cross'' sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the  on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the  for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt;
Cape Adare had been discovered by Antarctic explorer  during his . It lies at the end of a long ; below the Cape is a large triangular shingle , where Bull and Borchgrevink had made their brief landing in 1895. This foreshore is the site of one of the largest  rookeries on the entire continent and, as Borchgrevink had remarked in 1895, "On this particular spot, there is ample room for houses, tents and provisions".&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-intro/&gt; The abundance of penguins would provide both a winter larder and a fuel source.&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 14"&gt;Preston, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
Unloading began on 17 February. First ashore were the 75 dogs,&lt;ref name= ForEx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with their two Sami handlers, who remained with them and thus became the first men to spend a night on the Antarctic continent.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival&gt; (Arrival at Cape Adare)&lt;/ref&gt; During the next twelve days the rest of the equipment and supplies were landed, and two prefabricated huts were erected, one as living quarters and the other for storage.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-build&gt; (First Buildings)&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first buildings erected on the continent. A third structure was contrived from spare materials, to serve as a magnetic observation hut.&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 14"/&gt; The "living hut" was small to serve as accommodation for ten men, and seemingly precarious&#8212;Bernacchi later described it as "fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore".&lt;ref name= Crane153&gt;Crane, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-build/&gt; By 2 March the base, christened "Camp Ridley" after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name,&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt; was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised. That day, ''Southern Cross'' departed for Australia, to spend the winter there.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival/&gt;
Inside the living hut were two small ante-rooms, one used as a photographic , the other for . Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated the centre of the hut.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-build/&gt; During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt;
As the winter season took hold, the party was almost completely restricted to the cramped living quarters. This proved to be a difficult time; Bernacchi wrote of rising boredom and irritation: "Officers and men, ten of us in all, found tempers wearing thin".&lt;ref name="Crane153"/&gt; During this period of tension and confinement, Borchgrevink's qualities as a commander were found wanting; he was, wrote Bernacchi, "in many respects... not a good leader".&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt; Polar historian  writes that in conditions of "democratic anarchy", dirt, disorder and inactivity were the order of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;
Borchgrevink was not a trained scientist, and his incompetence with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern to some of the party.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart&gt; (Departure of the Expedition)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life&gt; (Life at Camp Ridley)&lt;/ref&gt; During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fumes as they slept.&lt;ref name="SouthPole3"/&gt;
The party was well-supplied with a variety of basic foodstuffs&#8212;butter, tea and coffee, herrings, sardines, cheeses, soup, tinned tripe, plum pudding, dry potatoes and vegetables.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt; However, there were soon complaints about the lack of luxuries, Colbeck noting that "all the tinned fruits supplied for the land party were either eaten on the passage or left on board for the [ship's] crew".&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt; There was also a shortage of tobacco, in spite of an intended provision of half a ton (500kg); only a quantity of chewing tobacco was landed.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt;
The zoologist, , had fallen ill during the winter. On 14 October 1899 he died, apparently of an intestinal disorder, and became the first person to be buried on the Antarctic continent. The grave was dynamited from the frozen ground at the summit of the Cape.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-burial&gt; (First Burial)&lt;/ref&gt; Bernacchi wrote: "There amidst profound silence and peace, there is nothing to disturb that eternal sleep except the flight of seabirds".&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Hanson left a wife, and a baby daughter born after he left for the Antarctic.&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt;
As winter gave way to spring, the party prepared for more ambitious inland journeys using the dogs and sledges. However, their base camp was cut off from the continent's interior by high mountain ranges, and journeys along the coastline were frustrated by unsafe sea ice. These factors severely restricted the extent of their exploration, which was largely confined to the vicinity of Robertson Bay.&lt;ref name= ForEx/&gt; Here, a small island was discovered, which was called , after the expedition's patron.&lt;ref name=Borch6&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later this find was dismissed by members of Scott's Discovery Expedition, who claimed that the island "did not exist",&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; but its position has since been confirmed at 71&#176;38&#8242;S, 170&#176;04&#8242;E.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
''Southern Cross'' returned to Cape Adare from Australia on 28 January 1900.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/&gt; Borchgrevink began  dismantling the camp and taking its remaining supplies on board, but soon abandoned this;  on 2 February he took the ship south into the Ross Sea.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/&gt; Evidence of a hasty and disorderly departure from Cape Adare was noted two years later, when the site was visited by members of the Discovery Expedition, after which  wrote; "...heaps of refuse all around, and a mountain of provision boxes, dead birds, seals, dogs, sledging gear... and heaven knows what else".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 9 January 1902, pp. 93&#8211;95&lt;/ref&gt;
The first port of call in the Ross Sea was Possession Island, where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered.&lt;ref name=SouthPole3/&gt; They then proceeded southwards, following the  coast and discovering further islands, one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham, whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour.&lt;ref name="Borch6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;Huxley, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; ''Southern Cross'' then sailed on to , observed the volcano , and attempted a landing at , at the foot of . Here, Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wake caused by a  or breakaway of ice from the adjacent .&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Following the path of  sixty years previously, they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge, to find the inlet where, in 1843, Ross had reached his .&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles (50 km) south since Ross's time, which meant that the ship were already south of Ross's record.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; However, Borchgrevink wished to make a landing on the Barrier itself. In the vicinity of Ross's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible.&lt;ref name= Amundsen/&gt; On 16 February he, Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge, ascended to the Barrier surface, and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78&#176;50&#8242;S, a new Farthest South record.&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 14"/&gt; They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface, earning Amundsen's approbation: "We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed".&lt;ref name= Amundsen&gt;Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 25&#8211;26&lt;/ref&gt;
Close to the same spot ten years later, Amundsen would establish his base camp "Framheim", prior to his successful South Pole journey.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 167&#8211;68&lt;/ref&gt;
On the passage northward, ''Southern Cross'' halted at , off the Victoria Land coast, and made a series of magnetic calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from .&lt;ref name= ForEx/&gt;
''Southern Cross'' returned to England in June 1900,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; to a cool welcome. In geographical circles there was still resentment at Borchgrevink's coup in obtaining the backing of Newnes, but public attention was, in any event, distracted by the preparations for the upcoming Discovery Expedition, due to sail the following year.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Borchgrevink meanwhile pronounced his voyage a great success, stating: "The Antarctic regions might be another "&#8212;in terms of the prospects for fishing, sealing, and mineral extraction.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-results&gt; (Results)&lt;/ref&gt; He had proved that it was possible for a resident expedition to survive an Antarctic winter, and had made a series of geographical discoveries. These included the new islands in Robertson's Bay and the Ross Sea, and the first landings on Franklin Island, Coulman Island, Ross Island and the Great Ice Barrier.&lt;ref name="Borch6"/&gt; The survey of the Victoria Land coast had revealed the "important geographical discovery... of the Southern Cross Fjord, as well as the excellent camping place at the foot of ".&lt;ref name="Borch6"/&gt; The most significant exploration achievement, he claimed, was the scaling of the Great Ice Barrier and the journey to "the furthest south ever reached by man".&lt;ref name="Borch6"/&gt;
Borchgrevink's account of the expedition, ''First on the Antarctic Continent'', was published the following year; the English edition, much of which may have been embroidered by Newnes's staff, was criticised for its "journalistic" style and for its bragging tone.&lt;ref name= adb/&gt;&lt;ref name= Huxley/&gt; The author, whom commentators recognised was "not known for either his modesty or his tact",&lt;ref name="Preston, p. 16"/&gt; embarked on a lecture tour of England and Scotland, but the reception was generally poor.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt;
Hugh Robert Mill stated that while the scientific results of the expedition were not so great as expected, many of Hanson's notes having mysteriously disappeared, the expedition was "interesting as a dashing piece of scientific work".&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-results/&gt; The meteorological and magnetic conditions of Victoria Land had been recorded for a full year; the location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated (though not visited); samples of the continent's natural fauna and flora, and of its geology, had been collected. Borchgrevink also claimed the discovery of new insect and shallow-water fauna species, proving "bi-polarity" (existence of species in proximity to the North and South poles).&lt;ref name="Borch6"/&gt;
The geographical establishments in Britain and abroad were slow to give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised. Markham persisted in his attacks on Borchgrevink, describing him as cunning and unprincipled;&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice. Scott's biographer David Crane surmises that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his expedition would have been treated differently in Britain, but "a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously".&lt;ref name="Crane74"/&gt; A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that "justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the ''Southern Cross'' expedition", and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; After the expedition, Borchgrevink lived quietly, largely out of the public eye. He died in Oslo on 21 April 1934.&lt;ref name= adb/&gt;

An '''ice shelf''' is a thick floating platform of ice that forms where a  or  flows down to a line and onto the ocean surface. Ice shelves are only found in ,  and .  The boundary between the floating ice shelf and the grounded (resting on bedrock) ice that feeds it is called the grounding line. The thickness of ice shelves ranges from about 100 to 1000 metres. 
In contrast,  is formed on water, is much thinner (typically less than 3m), and forms throughout the . It also is found in the  around the continent of .
Ice shelves are principally driven by -driven pressure from the grounded ice &lt;ref name="GreveBlatter2009"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That flow continually moves ice from the grounding line to the seaward front of the shelf.  The primary mechanism of mass loss from ice shelves is  , in which a chunk of ice breaks off from the seaward front of the shelf.  Typically, a shelf front will extend forward for years or decades between major calving events.  Snow accumulation on the upper surface and melting from the lower surface are also important to the ''mass balance'' of an ice shelf. Ice may also accrete onto the underside of the shelf. 
The density contrast between glacial ice, which is denser than normal ice, and liquid water means that only about 1/9 of the floating ice is above the ocean surface.  The world's largest ice shelves are the  and the  in Antarctica.
The term captured ice shelf has been used for the ice over a , such as .
All Canadian ice shelves are attached to  and lie north of 82&#176;N. Ice shelves that are still in existence are the , ,  and . The  broke up from 1963 to 1966; the  broke up in 2005; and the  broke up in 2008.

A total of 44 percent of the Antarctic coastline has ice shelves attached. Their aggregate area is 1,541,700km&#178; [http://www.stat.fi/tup/maanum/01_maantieteellisia_tietoja_aihepiireittain.xls].
In the last several decades, glaciologists have observed consistent decreases in ice shelf extent through melt, calving, and complete disintegration of some shelves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080710/sc_afp/warmingantarcticaice "Antarctic ice shelf 'hanging by thread': European scientists"].

The Ellesmere ice shelf reduced by 90 percent in the twentieth century, leaving the separate Alfred Ernest, Ayles, Milne, Ward Hunt, and Markham Ice Shelves.  A 1986 survey of Canadian ice shelves found that 48km&#178;. (3.3 cubic kilometers) of ice calved from the Milne and Ayles ice shelves between 1959 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;.

''Arctic'' 39 (1) (March 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ayles Ice Shelf calved entirely on August 13, 2005. The Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, the largest remaining section of thick (&gt;10 m) landfast sea ice along the northern coastline of Ellesmere Island, lost 600 square km of ice in a massive calving in 1961-1962.&lt;ref&gt;Hattersley-Smith, G.

''Polar Record'' 37 (201): 133-142 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2002, the Ward Ice Shelf experienced another major breakup.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Two sections of Antarctica's  broke apart into hundreds of unusually small fragments (hundreds of meters wide or less) in 1995 and 2002. 
The breakup events may be linked to the dramatic polar warming trends that are part of .  The leading ideas involve enhanced ice fracturing due to surface  and enhanced bottom melting due to warmer ocean water circulating under the floating ice.  
The cold, fresh water produced by melting underneath the Ross and Flichner-Ronne ice shelves is a component of .
Although it is believed that the melting of floating ice shelves will not raise sea levels, technically, there is a small effect because sea water is ~2.6% more dense than fresh water combined with the fact that ice shelves are overwhelmingly "fresh" (having virtually no salinity); this causes the volume of the sea water needed to displace a floating ice shelf to be slightly less than the volume of the fresh water contained in the floating ice.  Therefore, when a mass of floating ice melts, sea levels will increase; however, this effect is small enough that if all extant sea ice and floating ice shelves were to melt, the corresponding sea level rise is estimated to be ~4cm.
However, if and when these ice shelves melt sufficiently, they no longer impede glacier flow off the continent, so that glacier flow would accelerate.  This new source of ice volume would flow down from above sea level, thus resulting in its total mass contributing to sea rise.
