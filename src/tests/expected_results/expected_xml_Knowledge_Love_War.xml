[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|upright|Personification of knowledge ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Επιστημη'', [[Episteme]]) in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
'''Knowledge''' is a familiarity with someone or something, which can include [[fact]]s, [[information]],  [[description]]s,  or [[skills]] acquired through [[experience]] or [[education]]. It can refer to the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1261368#m_en_us1261368&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy]], the study of knowledge is called [[epistemology]]; the philosopher [[Plato]] famously defined knowledge as &quot;[[justified true belief]].&quot; However, no single agreed upon definition of knowledge exists, though there are numerous theories to explain it. The following quote from Bertrand Russell's &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot; illustrates the difficulty in defining knowledge: &quot;The question how knowledge should be defined is perhaps the most important and difficult of the three with which we shall deal. This may seem surprising: at first sight it might be thought that knowledge might be defined as belief which is in agreement with the facts. The trouble is that no one knows what a belief is, no one knows what a fact is, and no one knows what sort of agreement between them would make a belief true. Let us begin with belief.&quot;

Knowledge acquisition involves complex [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes: perception, communication, association and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of ''acknowledgment'' in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Cavell, &quot;Knowing and Acknowledging,&quot; ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 238–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of knowledge==
[[File:Knowledge-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]], ''Knowledge'' (1896). [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
{{see also|Epistemology}}
{{cquote2
|The eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophy's core was &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their ''foundation''… Without this idea of a &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; it is hard to imagine what &quot;philosophy&quot; could have been in the age of modern science.|[[Richard Rorty]]|''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The  definition of knowledge is a matter of on-going [[debate]] among [[philosopher]]s in the field of [[epistemology]]. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;In Plato's ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of ''knowledge'': knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt; specifies that a [[statement (logic)|statement]] must meet three [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in order to be considered knowledge: it must be [[theory of justification|justified]], [[truth|true]], and [[belief|believed]]. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as [[Gettier case]] examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn|Simon Blackburn's]] additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. [[Richard Kirkham]] suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this approach, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] observed, following [[Moore's paradox]], that one can say &quot;He believes it, but it isn't so&quot;, but not &quot;He knows it, but it isn't so&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[On Certainty]]'', remark 42&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way &quot;knowledge&quot; is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]]. Following this idea, &quot;knowledge&quot; has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk-Mazouz, N. (2008): &quot;Internet and the flow of knowledge&quot;, in: Hrachovec, H.; Pichler, A. (Hg.): Philosophy of the Information Society. Proceedings of the 30. International Ludwig Wittgenstein Symposium Kirchberg am Wechsel, Austria 2007. Volume 2, Frankfurt, Paris, Lancaster, New Brunswik: Ontos, S. 215–232. http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/philo/fileadmin/doc/pdf/gottschalk/ngm-internetflow-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating knowledge==
[[File:Los portadores de la antorcha.jpg|thumb|''Los portadores de la antorcha'' &lt;br&gt; Sculpture by [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]] about the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next &lt;br&gt;([[Complutense University of Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain]])]]
[[Symbolic linguistic representation|Symbolic representation]]s can be used to indicate meaning and can be thought of as a dynamic process. Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one [[wikt:ascription|ascription]] process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and [[semioticians]] construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

While many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays ''[[Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology|Technopoly]]'' Neil Postman demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, pp 73). In this excerpt the scholar [[Socrates]] recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word. In this story, Theuth presents his new invention &quot;writing&quot; to King Thamus, telling Thamus that his new invention &quot;will improve both the wisdom and memory of the Egyptians&quot; (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly, Vintage, New York, pp 74). King Thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge. He argues that the written word will infect the Egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York,pp 74).

Andrew Robinson also highlights, in his work ''The Origins of Writing'', the possibility for writing to be used to spread false information and therefore the ability of the written word to decrease social knowledge (Robinson, Andrew (2003) ''The Origins of Writing'' in Crowley and Heyer (eds) Communication in History: Technology, Culture, Society, Boston pp 34). People are often internalizing new information which they perceive to be knowledge but in reality fill their minds with false knowledge.  

The above points are moot in the modern world. Verbal communication lends itself to the spread of falsehoods much more so than written, as there is no record of exactly what was said or who originally said it (usually neither the source nor the content can be verified). Gossip and rumors are common examples.  As to value of writing, the extent of human knowledge is now so great that it is only possible to record it and to communicate it through writing. Major libraries today can have millions of books of knowledge (in addition to works of fiction). It is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity.  Verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those few who would have contact with the transmitter person - far too limited for today's world.  Writing is still the most available and most universal of all forms of recording and transmitting knowledge.  It stands unchallenged as mankind's primary technology of knowledge transfer down through the ages and to all cultures and languages of the world.

==Situated knowledge==
Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna 1998. ''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods of generating knowledge, such as [[trial and error]], or learning from [[experience]], tend to create highly situational knowledge. One of the main attributes of the [[scientific method]] is that the theories it generates are much less situational than knowledge gained by other methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
Situational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Knowledge generated through experience is called knowledge &quot;a posteriori&quot;, meaning afterwards. The pure existence of a term like &quot;a posteriori&quot; means this also has a counterpart. In this case that is knowledge &quot;a priori&quot;, meaning before. The knowledge prior to any experience means that there are certain &quot;assumptions&quot; that one takes for granted. For example if you are being told about a [[chair]] it is clear to you that the chair is in [[space]], that it is [[three dimensional space|3D]]. This knowledge is not knowledge that one can &quot;forget&quot;, even someone suffering from amnesia experiences the world in 3D. See also: ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori and a posteriori]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Partial knowledge==
One discipline of [[epistemology]] focuses on [[dispersed knowledge|partial knowledge]]. In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

This idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.

==Scientific knowledge==

The development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge is acquired. To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]&quot;, {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794–6}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.  
&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy]].  As science itself has developed, knowledge has developed a broader usage which has been developing within biology/psychology—discussed elsewhere as [[meta-epistemology]], or [[genetic epistemology]], and to some extent related to &quot;[[theory of cognitive development]]&quot;. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Image:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], &quot;[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]&quot;]] Note that &quot;[[epistemology]]&quot; is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is &quot;the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.&quot; [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, &quot;[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]&quot;, is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans — and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to (ii)&amp;nbsp;''Society-as-such'', as in (e.g.) &quot;the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture&quot; (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains—e.g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically &quot;transcendental&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; — a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of &quot;''[[infinite regress]]''&quot; can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited &quot;pseudo-transcendentals&quot; inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations. See also &quot;[[Tacit knowledge]]&quot;.

Other biological domains where &quot;knowledge&quot; might be said to reside, include: (iii) the ''immune system'', and (iv) in the ''DNA of the genetic code''. See the list of four &quot;epistemological domains&quot;: &amp;nbsp; [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). &quot;The rationality of scientific revolutions&quot;; in Rom Harré (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''. Clarendon Press: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and Traill (2008:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ondwelle.com/OSM02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Table&amp;nbsp;S, page&amp;nbsp;31)—also references by both to [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Niels Jerne]].

Such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of &quot;knowledge&quot; to cover the biological systems. For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:
* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').
* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of &quot;the outside world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;outside world&quot; could include other subsystems within the same organism—e.g. different &quot;mental levels&quot; corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].&lt;/ref&gt; or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).
* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.

Scientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious meaning of knowledge==
In many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831
|title=Part Three, No. 1831
|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church
|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: &quot;And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil…&quot; ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})

In [[Gnosticism]] divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained. In [[Thelema]] knowledge and conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel is the purpose of life.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

विद्या दान (Vidya Daan) i.e. knowledge sharing is a major part of [[Dāna|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva Knowledge Donation is the primary donation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''. ''Paroksh Gyan'' (also spelled ''Paroksha-Jnana'') is secondhand knowledge: knowledge obtained from books, hearsay, etc. ''Prataksh Gyan'' (also spelled ''Prataksha-Jnana'') is the knowledge borne of direct experience, i.e., knowledge that one discovers for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Islam, knowledge (Arabic: علم, ''ʿilm'') is given great significance. &quot;The Knowing&quot; (''al-ʿAlīm'') is one of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names]] reflecting distinct attributes of [[God in Islam|God]]. The [[Qur'an]] asserts that knowledge comes from God ({{cite quran|2|239|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and various ''[[hadith]]'' encourage the acquisition of knowledge. [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said &quot;Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave&quot; and &quot;Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets&quot;. Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title ''[[ulema|alim]]'', meaning &quot;knowledgable&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In [[Jewish]] tradition, knowledge ([[Hebrew]]: דעת ''da'ath'') is considered one of the most valuable traits a person can acquire. Observant Jews recite three times a day in the [[Amidah]] &quot;Favor us with knowledge, understanding and discretion that come from you. Exalted are you, Existent-One, the gracious giver of knowledge.&quot; The [[Tanakh]] states, &quot;A wise man gains power, and a man of knowledge maintains power&quot;, and &quot;knowledge is chosen above gold&quot;.

In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure (&quot;I loved that meal&quot;) to [[interpersonal attraction]] (&quot;I love my partner&quot;). &quot;Love&quot; may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of [[romance (love)|romantic love]], to the sexual love of [[eros (concept)|eros]], to the emotional closeness of [[familial love|familial]] love, to the [[platonic love]] that defines [[friendship]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatonicSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University |year=1980 |isbn=0-691-02010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the profound [[Henosis|oneness]] or devotion of [[Religious views on love|religious love]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gita&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-044918-3}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;, or to a concept of '''love''' that encompasses all of those feelings. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define,  compared to other emotional states.

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love|url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why we love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Love table}}
The word &quot;love&quot; can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often, other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on &quot;love&quot; to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for &quot;love.&quot;]] [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships.

When discussed in the abstract, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Ancient Love Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from [[Virgil|Virgil's]] &quot;[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]&quot; to [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[All You Need Is Love]]&quot;. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as &quot;to will the good of another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of &quot;absolute value,&quot; as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is &quot;to be delighted by the happiness of another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Love is sometimes referred to as being the &quot;international language&quot;, overriding cultural and linguistic divisions.

==Impersonal love==
A person can be said to love an object, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' &quot;love&quot; of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; &quot;The Art of Loving&quot;, Harper Perennial (September 5, 2000), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt; People can also &quot;love&quot; material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = DiscoveryHealth | first = | title = Paraphilia | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480-1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding of the nature and function of love. 

People with  [[histrionic personality disorder]] and [[narcissism]] may have a limited or minimal capability for experiencing love.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PB2BVBcyb9oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAc0T5aNH-er0QX8s8WvAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Personality Disorders: Recognition and Clinical Management] retrieved 9 February 2012, Jonathan H.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas | coauthors = Amini, F., &amp; Lannon, R. | title = [[A General Theory of Love]] | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=0-375-70922-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot;&gt;
http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf Deﬁning the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and also three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot; /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including [[pheromones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], which act in a manner similar to [[amphetamine]]s, stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-03-093780-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Psychological basis===
{{further2|[[Human bonding]]}}
Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three. &lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (1986). &quot;A triangular theory of love&quot;. Psychological Review 93 (2): 119–135. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.&lt;/ref&gt;American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 0-201-00560-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the &quot;concern for the spiritual growth of another,&quot; and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name=&quot;peck&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=0-671-25067-1 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book &quot;[[The art of loving]]&quot; that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the &quot;feeling&quot; of love is superficial in comparison to ones commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, ones self, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Fromm also described Love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans comparative to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. There are probably elements of truth in both views. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[Nerve Growth Factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

===Ancient Greek===
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word &quot;love&quot; is used. For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a &quot;pure,&quot; [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as &quot;love of the soul.&quot;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as &quot;love of the body.&quot;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean &quot;love of the mind.&quot;

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot; ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—&quot;friend&quot;—and ''amicitia'', &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called [[Art of Love|''Ars Amatoria'']] (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot; ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[Image:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|&quot;Ai,&quot; the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (middle) inside of &quot;accept,&quot; &quot;feel,&quot; or &quot;perceive,&quot; which shows a graceful emotion. It can also be interpreted as a hand offering ones heart to another hand.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]''  (&quot;benevolent love&quot;, 仁), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (愛) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. ''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (''Wo xihuan ni'', 我喜欢你) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, &quot;[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', 好きだ). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.

===Persian===
[[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] are icons of the passion and love that the [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and language present. The Persian word for love is ''eshgh'' {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, derived from the Arabic ''ishq'', however is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for 'doost dashtan' ('liking'){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life {{cn|date=October 2012}}. Over seven centuries ago, Sa'di wrote:

::::''The children of Adam are limbs of one body''
::::''Having been created of one essence.''
::::''When the calamity of time afflicts one limb''
::::''The other limbs cannot remain at rest.''
::::''If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others''
::::''You are not worthy to be called by the name of &quot;man.&quot;''

===Japanese===
[[Image:Ohatu and tokubei.jpg|right|thumb|Ohatsu and Tokubei, characters of ''[[Sonezaki Shinjū]]'']]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''ai'' (愛) is passionate caring love, and a fundamental desire. It can develop towards either selfishness or selflessness and enlightenment. ''[[Amae]]'' (甘え), a Japanese word meaning &quot;indulgent dependence,&quot; is part of the child-rearing [[culture of Japan]]. Japanese mothers are expected to hug and indulge their children, and children are expected to reward their mothers by clinging and serving. Some [[sociologist]]s have suggested that Japanese social interactions in later life are modeled on the mother-child amae.

===Turkish (Shaman and Islamic)===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;aşk.&quot; ''[[Ishq|Aşk]]'' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being &quot;in love&quot; (Aşık), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for [[Turkic languages]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (eşq) and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] (ғашық).

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html
|author=Pope Benedict XVI
|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for &quot;love&quot; that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as &quot;brotherly love.&quot;
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote &quot;''Love God, and do as thou wilt''.&quot;

[[Image:baglione.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sacred Love Versus Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poem in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.&quot; ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, ''&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot;'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, ''&quot;Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;'' ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

Saint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, ''“I was in love with love.”'' Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as ''“jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.”'' According to Saint Augustine, to love God is ''“to attain the peace which is yours.”'' (Saint Augustine's Confessions)

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] wrote his first [[encyclical]] on &quot;[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]&quot;. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;/&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;/&gt;  This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies.  As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

====Judaism====
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Ahava'' is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as [[loving-kindness]], is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, &quot;Love your neighbor like yourself&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] &quot;with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: &quot;See life with the wife you love&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as &quot;giving without expecting to take&quot; (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or &quot;the Loving One,&quot; which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being &quot;full of loving kindness.&quot;

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or &quot;deep kindness&quot; as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God &quot;looks&quot; at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being &quot;drunk&quot; due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Love.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====
[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama_in_Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prem]]a''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning &quot;loving devotion to the supreme God.&quot; A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unaldulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation) — two opposites .&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishna Prema&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything — one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visibile in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the [[Gita Govinda]] and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God (taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya), and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination (krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya).  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
=== Free love ===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term '''free love''' has been used &lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement’s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. &quot;The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.&quot; Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of [[anarchism]], and reflects a [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to &quot;fulfill earthly human happiness.&quot; Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision on strongly defined gender roles, which led to the advancement of the free love movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurlock, John C 1988&quot;&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that love relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.

The term &quot;'''sex radical'''&quot; is also used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;, and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of &quot;free love&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Passet, Joanne E 2003&quot;&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago,IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[adultery]] and [[divorce]], as well as [[age of consent]], [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], [[abortion]], and sometimes [[prostitution]]; although not all free love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.

== Philosophical views ==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
Philosophy of love is the field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] which attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[love]]. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love; asking if and how love is/can be justified; asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is; and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.

There are many different theories which attempt to [[explanation|explain]] what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

{{About|war in general||War (disambiguation)|and|The War (disambiguation)}}
{{War}}'''War''' is an organized, armed, and, often, a prolonged conflict that is carried on between [[State (polity)|states]], [[nation]]s, or other parties typified by extreme [[aggression]], [[Society|social]] disruption, and usually high mortality.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of [[political violence]].&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as '''warfare'''. An absence of war (and other violence) is usually called [[peace]].

In 2003, Nobel Laureate [[Richard E. Smalley]] identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smalley Institute Grand Challenges |first=Richard E. |last=Smalley |publisher=[[Rice University]] |year=2008 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |url=http://cnst.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1832 [[treatise]] ''[[On War]]'', Prussian military general and theoretician [[Carl von Clausewitz]] defined war as follows: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Clausewitz|first1= Carl von|authorlink1= Carl Von Clausewitz|editor1-first= Michael|editor1-last= Howard|editor1-link=Peter Paret|editor2-first= Peter|editor2-last= Paret |title= On War|trans_title= Vom Krieg |edition= Indexed |year= 1984 |origyear= 1832|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= New Jersey |isbn= 978-0-691-01854-6|page= 75}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human culture, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by [[John Keegan]] in his ''History of Warfare'', war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John, (1901) ''A History of Warfare'', (Pimlico)&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Societies at Peace (Howell and Willis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ever changing technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the one end lies the [[endemic warfare]] of the [[Paleolithic]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with its stones and clubs, and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons. Found at the other end of this continuum is [[nuclear warfare]], along with the recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of the complete [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]].]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (c.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre''; the [[Old French|Old North French]] ''werre''; the [[Franks|Frankish]] ''werra''; and the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''werso''. The denotation of ''war'' derives from the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'': “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited derivation is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''barbaros'', the [[Old Persian]] ''varhara'', and the Sanskrit ''varvar'' and ''barbara''. In German, the equivalent is ''Krieg''; the equivalent Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Italian words for &quot;war&quot; is ''guerra'', derived from the Germanic ''werra'' (“fight”, “tumult”).&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Lengua Española'', 21&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; edición (1992) p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for &quot;war&quot;, to avoid using the [[Latin]] ''bellum'', because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word ''bello'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

==History of warfare==
{{Main|History of war}}
Before the dawn of civilization, war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a [[Nubia]]n cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;&gt;Keeley: ''War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage''&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, &quot;One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W. Henderson|title=Understanding International Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AwMovLqKw2oC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=9 February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9764-9|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], says that approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|300px|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, Archeologist)]]
Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were perpetrated by primitive societies. The use of the massacre by pre-state societies can be exhibited by the [[Dogrib people|Dogrib]] tribes of the subarctic in North America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing 4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt; This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never recovered. Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate societies. The protection provided by a defensive could not justify the valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote that &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [ie, after the coming of the Europeans]'. At [[Crow Creek massacre|Crow Creek]], South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a [[mass grave]] of 'more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. AD 1325)' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. D. Rubinstein|title=Genocide: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-50601-5|pages=22–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name=War&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's &quot;Peace and Conflict&quot; study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J. Wilkenfield and T. nevertheless the concept war is more than just a word but a signification to the meaning Death. Gurr ''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/pc/ Peace and Conflict 2008]'', Paradigm Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[Mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may hopefully altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

Shortly after [[World War II]], as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;EinsteinWWIV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortunately, the anticipated costs of a possible third world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.

Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue, and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even advocated for the proclamation of another world war.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewsCommentators&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Ten largest wars (by death toll)==
{{Main|List of wars by death toll}}
Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are of course the two World Wars, then followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all other war-death-tolls by a factor of two. This may be due to significant recent advances in weapons technologies, as well as recent increases in the overall human population.

==Types of warfare==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
War, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within the broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. [[War Studies]] by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish civil war]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
In general, modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|National defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.

[[Conventional warfare]] is an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.

The opposite of conventional warfare, [[unconventional warfare]], is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.

[[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.

Civil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.

[[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric conflicts often result in [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.

Intentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called [[chemical warfare]]. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]], are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.

===Warfare environment===
The environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops' mobility limitations or enablers.
These don't include :

===Behaviour and conduct in war===
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. ''New Glory: Expanding America's Global Supremacy'', 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in [[genocide]], [[war rape]] and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in [[World War I]] by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert. 1984. ''The Evolution of Cooperation.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of non-aggression, also from [[World War I]], are detailed in &quot;[[Good-Bye to All That]].&quot; These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of [[World War I]] was the [[Christmas truce]].

The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden in World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=James|title=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On soldiers===
Soldiers subject to combat in war often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest that most soldiers resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving soldiers will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.|''14–18: Understanding the Great War'', Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}

Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, for example, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics].

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the [[American Civil War]]. In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the [[Great Depression]]) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====World War II====
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the [[Second World War]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html &quot;World War II&quot;] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P.

By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pilisuk|author2=Jennifer Achord Rountree|title=Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r9kNZrmG0E8C&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99435-8|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors ending a war==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}

{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}

The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war, usually depend on the [[facts on the ground]]. Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a [[stalemate]], they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the [[antebellum period|antebellum]] territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a [[treaty]], such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, which ended the [[First World War]].

A warring party that [[surrender (military)|surrenders]] or [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulates]] may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An [[unconditional surrender]] is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the [[Empire of Japan]] gave an unconditional surrender to the [[Allies of World War II]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] (see [[Surrender of Japan]]), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through [[deception]] or bluffing.

Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BCE)|Battle of Carthage]] of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Carthage]] and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.

Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side. A raid for the purposes of [[looting]] may be completed with the successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Some hostilities, such as [[insurgency]] or civil war, may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease active military engagement but still threaten each other. An example is the [[Chinese Civil War]] which essentially ceased by 1950 but the People's Republic of China fought diplomatically to isolate Taiwan, but it still threatens [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as [[Taiwan]]) with an invasion. For this reason, some historians consider the war not ended but continuing.

==Efforts to stop wars==
[[File:1917 - Execution à Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|Execution at Verdun at the time of the [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] of 1917, when parts of the French Army refused to conduct further offensive operations.]]
Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against international terrorism that caused the [[September 11 attacks]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, work on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist significant worldwide [[opposition to the Iraq War]]. Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and perceived illegitimacy. 

The [[Mexican Drug War]], with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many have died in Mexico's drug war? |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologises to drug war victims |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments also use the method of [[disarmament]] to stop and prevent the cost of war.

==Theories for motivation==
There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Jack S.|year=1989|title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence|journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War|volume=I|page=295|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|editor1-first=Philip E.|editor1-last=Tetlock|editor2-first=Jo L.|editor2-last=Husbands|editor3-first=Robert|editor3-last=Jervis|editor4-first=Paul C.|editor4-last=Stern|editor5-first=Charles|editor5-last=Tilly|accessdate=4 May 2012|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome's leaders may have wished to make war with [[Carthage]] for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.

An interpretation of the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between [[Cain and Abel]] in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economics, B) Power, and C) Religion.&lt;ref name = &quot;MidrashQuote&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Tatars essentially sought booty, especially [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]].]]
In ''Why Nations Go to War'', by [[John G. Stoessinger]], the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on [[Fundamental attribution error|misperceptions of the enemy's intentions]].

As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. [[Carl Von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593&lt;/ref&gt; The one constant factor is war’s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.

===Psychoanalytic psychology===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;meerloo&quot;&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p.134, Progressive Press, ISBN 978-1-61577-376-3
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought that war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. &quot;The Origin of Great Wars.&quot; ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

===Evolutionary ===
{{POV-section|date=October 2011}}
{{Disputed-section|date=October 2011}}
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population density and political organization and competition over resources. The other school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

This school argues that since organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = &quot;ApesWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior. Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Crofoot, Margaret C. and Richard W. Wrangham, 2010 &quot;Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified Theory&quot; in Kappeler, Thomas M &amp; Joan B Silk (eds) ''Mind the Gap – tracing the origins of human universals''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and large-scale state formations.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995.

One line of evidence for violent conflict among the ancestors of humans is [[sexual dimorphism]]. In species that have high levels of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our nearest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewin and Robert Foley. 2004 Principles of human evolution, 2nd ed.p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; The strength difference is greater for upper-body strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger, faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important factor in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and [[preemptive war]]s were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (&quot;[[honor]]&quot;). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the [[Chewong language|Chewong]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Crofoot and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.&lt;ref name=HumanPrimateAggression&gt;&quot;Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals&quot; By Peter M.

War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike.

===Marxist ===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxembourg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[economic market|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxist Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and [[youth bulge]] theories.

====Malthusian ====
[[File:US soldiers in Kismayo, 1993.JPEG|thumb|US Army soldiers in [[Somalia]], 1993]]
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=200] |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the [[Developed country|developed world]], where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where [[birth control]] has dramatically slowed the increase in population.

====Youth bulge====
[[File:Median age.png|thumb|300px|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent for South and Southeast Asia and Central America.]]
[[Youth bulge]] theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts – as graphically represented as a &quot;youth bulge&quot; in a [[population pyramid]] – with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.

While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, 'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of [[division of labour]].

Contributors to the development of [[youth bulge]] theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,&lt;ref&gt;Bouthoul, Gaston: &quot;L`infanticide différé&quot; (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sociologist [[Jack Goldstone|Jack A.

Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has modified his [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:

{{quote|I don't think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.

During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don't think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology.&lt;ref&gt;‘So, are civilizations at war?’, Interview with Samuel P. Huntington by Michael Steinberger, The Observer, Sunday October 21, 2001 [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/islam/story/0,,577982,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General [[John L. Helgerson]] referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends&quot;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palestinian militant with rifle.png|thumb|Palestinian militant with rifle, 2009]]
According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.

A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a [[sub-replacement fertility]] rate leading to [[population decline]].

Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4–8 children per mother implies 2–4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many &quot;angry young men&quot; find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are

# Demographically superfluous,
# Might be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and
# Often have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. ''See: [[Hypergamy]], [[Waithood]]''.

The combination of these [[stress (biological)|stress]] factors according to Heinsohn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/DefenceTraining.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:12 |title=Heinsohn, G.(2006): &quot;Demography and War.&quot; |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually heads for one of six different exits:
[[File:Detenciones Michoacán.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican soldiers detain [[Mexican Drug War|cartel]] suspects in Michoacán, 2007]]
# Emigration (&quot;non-violent [[colonization]]&quot;)
# Violent Crime
# Rebellion or [[putsch]]
# Civil war and/or revolution
# [[Genocide]] (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)
# [[Conquest (military)|Conquest]] (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).

Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism and today's &quot;Islamist&quot; civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005): &quot;Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century.&quot; [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:15]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Gaza Strip]] now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence, especially if compared to [[Lebanon]] which is geographically close, yet remarkably more peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Among prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of economic depression hitting the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, Comparative Studies in Society and

While the implications of population growth have been known since the completion of the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html |title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) – April 1974 |publisher=Population-security.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither the U.S. nor the WHO have implemented the recommended measures to control population growth to avert the terrorist threat.

===Rationalist===
Rationalist theories of war assume that both sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since [[Carl von Clausewitz]], that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.
Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, [[information asymmetry]] with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. 1995. &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War.&quot; International Organization 49, 3: 379–414. [http://www.polisci.ucsd.edu/~bslantch/courses/pdf/fearon-io1995v49n3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.

A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as [[Geoffrey Blainey]], is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.

Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the bargaining [[failure]] by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that [[Hermann Göring]] only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

The American decision to enter the [[Vietnam War]] was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose [[United States armed forces|American forces]].

Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2002. &quot;Bargaining Theory and International Conflict.&quot; ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 5: 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.

Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship. Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.

Rationalist theories are usually explicated with [[game theory]], for example, the [[Peace war game|Peace War Game]], not a [[Military simulation|wargame]] as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.

===Political science===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.
Which sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are [[Democracy|democracies]] do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the [[democratic peace theory]]. Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.

Another major theory relating to [[power in international relations]] and ''[[Power politics|machtpolitik]]'' is the [[Power Transition theory]], which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of [[hegemony|hegemons]] being destabilized by a [[great power]] which does not support the hegemons' control.

Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.&lt;ref name = &quot;MilitaryAdventurism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==War ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|200px|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to serious [[morality|moral]] questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=Conclusion|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: [[Pacifists]], who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.

There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: The [[Just War Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-09067-2|page=304|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; First is [[Jus ad bellum]] (literally translated as &quot;right to war&quot;), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|work=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. [[Jus in bello]], which literally translates to &quot;right in war&quot;, are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in ''jus in bello'' are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 324 In besieged Leningrad.jpg|thumb|210px|In besieged [[Leningrad]]. &quot;Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the '[[General Plan East]]'.&quot;  – ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.''&lt;ref&gt;[[I.C.B. Dear|Ian Dear]], [[M.R.D. Foot|Michael Richard Daniell Foot]] (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.'' Oxford University Press. p.88. ISBN 0-19-860446-7&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=Introduction|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in [[International Law]]'s regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;/&gt;

These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps: [[Marxist]] and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.

Marxism, and other such [[historicist]] ideals, hold that history advances through a set of [[dialectics]] (as stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]]: thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that history advances through violence. [[Marxism-Leninism]], in fact, held the belief that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple Capitalism and free the [[proletariat]]. In these theories, the question of ethics has no place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the revolution or synthesis.

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], Racism, and [[Social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-87157-X|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]].
