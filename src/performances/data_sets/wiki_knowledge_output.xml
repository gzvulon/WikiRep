}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply the '''cat''' when there is no need to distinguish it from other [[Felidae|felids]] and [[Felinae|felines]]. Cats are valued by humans for companionship and ability to hunt [[vermin]] and household pests.

Cats are similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. [[Cat senses]] fit a [[crepuscular]] and predatory [[ecological niche]]. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small game.  They can see in near darkness. Like most mammals, cats have poorer [[color vision]] and a better [[Olfaction|sense of smell]] than humans.

Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and [[cat communication]] includes the use of a variety of [[Animal communication|vocalization]]s ([[meowing]], [[purr]]ing, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, [[growling]] and [[Guttural|grunting]]) as well as [[cat pheromone|pheromone]]s and types of [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moelk&quot; /&gt;

Cats have a rapid breeding rate.  Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as [[Cat registry|registered]] pedigree pets, a hobby known as [[cat fancy]]. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, and the [[Abandoned pets|abandonment of former household pets]], has resulted in large numbers of [[feral cat]]s worldwide, with a population of up to 60&amp;nbsp;million of these animals in the United States alone, while in Japan they are caught and disposed of.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rochlitz |first=Irene |title=The Welfare of Cats |series=&quot;Animal Welfare&quot; series |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |pages=141–175 |isbn=1-4020-6143-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature and etymology==
The English word ''[[:wikt:cat#English|cat]]'' ([[Old English]] ''catt'') is in origin a loanword, introduced to many [[languages of Europe]] from Latin ''cattus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=George H.|title=English Words and Their Background|publisher=D. Appleton and Company {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}} |location=New York|date=1923|pages=130|url=http://www.questia.com/read/59505424/english-words-and-their-background}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Byzantine Greek]] {{lang|grc|κάττα}}, including [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''gato'', [[French language|French]] ''chat'', [[German language|German]] ''Katze'', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''katė'' and [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''kotka'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/28649?rskey=dmMbdW&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid|title=Cat|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate source of the word is [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], presumably from [[Late Egyptian]] ''čaute'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. &quot;chat&quot; (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; the feminine of ''čaus'' &quot;wildcat&quot;. The word was introduced, together with the domestic animal itself, to the [[Roman Republic]] by the 1st century BCE.{{citation needed|date=September 2012|reason=There's no source for this anyway, but it sounds suspiciously late, so the eventual source needs to be unusually reliable to support such an unusual claim.}}
An alternative word with cognates in many languages is English ''[[:wikt:puss#English|puss]]'' (''pussycat''). Attested only from the 16th century, it may have been introduced from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' or from [[Low German]] ''puuskatte'', related to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''kattepus'', or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''pus'', ''pusekatt''. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín''. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/155147#eid27609702|title=Puss|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gramercy Unabridged&quot;&gt;''Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language''. New York: Gramercy Books, 1996, p. 1571.&lt;/ref&gt;

The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its &quot;sire&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/180366?rskey=YylU4E&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid|title=Sire|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its female progenitor is its &quot;dam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/46999?rskey=P7m3OJ&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid|title=Dam, n.2|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Early Modern English]], the word ''kitten'' was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word ''catling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/28995?redirectedFrom=catling#eid|title=Catling|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s.  Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]])), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral species from which domestic cats are descended, there are several intermediate stages between domestic pet and pedigree cats on the one hand and those entirely wild animals on the other. The semi-feral cat is a mostly outdoor cat that is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage in rubbish, but are wary of human interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw1999&quot; /&gt;

This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a &quot;pacing&quot; [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a &quot;diagonal&quot; gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christensen 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

As cats are familiar and easily kept animals, their physiology has been particularly well studied; it generally resembles that of other carnivorous mammals but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats' descent from desert-dwelling species.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot; /&gt; For instance, cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures: Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about 44.5&amp;nbsp;°C (112&amp;nbsp;°F), but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around 52&amp;nbsp;°C (126&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|46}} and can tolerate temperatures of up to 56&amp;nbsp;°C (133&amp;nbsp;°F) if they have access to water.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDCN&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Cats have excellent [[night vision]] and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43}} This is partly the result of cat eyes having a [[tapetum lucidum]], which reflects any light that passes through the [[retina]] back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olliver 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Cats can suffer from a wide range of health problems, including infectious diseases, parasites, injuries and chronic disease. [[Feline vaccination|Vaccinations]] are available for many of these diseases, and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.

===Hunting and feeding===
Cats feed on small prey, primarily birds and rodents.&lt;ref name=Woods/&gt; Feral cats and house cats that are free-fed tend to consume many small meals in a single day, although the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bradshaw JW, Goodwin D, Legrand-Defrétin V, Nott HM |title=Food selection by the domestic cat, an obligate carnivore |journal=Comp.

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching.

===Reproduction===

[[File:Cats having sex in Israel.jpg|thumb|When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to [[mating]] known as [[lordosis behavior]].]]

Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt; Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her. This is because a male [[cat's penis]] has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about one millimeter long;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson 1967&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which is a trigger for [[ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After mating, the female will wash her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt;

Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wildt 1980&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Some of the same factors that have promoted [[adaptive radiation]] of island [[Bird|avifauna]] over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non-native species in modern time. The susceptibility inherent of many island birds is undoubtedly due to evolution in the absence of mainland predators, competitors, diseases and parasites. In addition to lower reproductive rates and extended incubation periods.&lt;ref name=dowd&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dowding|first=J.E.|coauthors=Murphy, E.C.|year=2001 |title=The Impact of Predation be Introduced Mammals on Endemic Shorebirds in New Zealand: A Conservation Perspective |journal=Biological Conservation|volume=99|pages=47–64|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00187-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of flight, or reduced flying ability is also characteristic of many island endemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whiting|first=M.F.|coauthors=Bradler, S. and Maxwell, T.|year=2003 |title=Loss and Recovery of Wings in Stick Insects |journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=264–267|doi=10.1038/nature01313|pmid=12529642|issue=6920}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological aspects have increased vulnerability to extinction in the presence of introduced species, such as the domestic cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=WCMC|first=.|year=1992|title=World Conservation Monitoring Centre.|publisher=Chapman and Hall. |coauthor=McComb, J., Groombridge, B., Byford, E., Allan, C., Howland, J., Magin, C., Smith, H., Greenwood, V. and Simpson, L.|isbn=2-8317-0156-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, behavioural traits exhibited by island species, such as &quot;predatory naivety&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steadman|first=D.W.|coauthors=Martin, P.S.|year=2003 |title=The Late Quaternary Extinction and Future Resurrection of Birds on Pacific Islands |journal=Earth Science Reviews|volume=61|pages=133–147|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00116-2|bibcode=2003ESRv...61..133S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ground-nesting,&lt;ref name=dowd/&gt; have also contributed to their susceptibility.

===Census===
There are approximately 220 million domestic cats in the world, according to the [http://www.ifaheurope.org International Federation for Animal Health Europe (IFAH)].

Total estimated numbers of domestic cats in top cat-owning countries and regions are as follows (figures have been rounded to the nearest million plus one decimal place):

* Cats in the USA: 93.6 million owned cats according to the Humane Society of the United States (plus 60 to 100 million ferals, according to Stray Pet Advocacy)
* Cats in Europe: 60 million pet cats according to the European Pet Food Industry Federation
* Cats in China: 58 million according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture &quot;Pet Food Update&quot; (2007)
* Cats in Australia: More than 18 million ferals according to the New South Wales Game Council plus 2.65 million owned cats according to Wildlife Extra
* Cats in Russia: 17.8 million according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture &quot;Consumer Trends: Pet Food in Russia&quot; (2009)
* Cats in Brazil: 11 million according to ExportAmerica

* Cats in Italy: 7.5 million owned cats according to Dundon et al. (2010), &quot;Serologic Evidence of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Infection in Dogs, Italy&quot;; 9.4 million according to Maps of the World (the latter number may include ferals)
* Cats in Ukraine: 7.4 million according to Maps of the World
* Cats in Poland: 6 million according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Pet Food Update (2007)
* Cats in India: 3.9 million (figure extrapolated using a combination of Dr. Sands' cat-to-human ratios from Cats:500 Questions Answered and CIA population statistics)
*Cats in the Netherlands: 3 million according to B.B. Chomel (2010), &quot;Zoonosis in the Bedroom,&quot; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
* Cats in Spain: 2.8 million (figure extrapolated using a combination of Dr. Sands' cat-to-human ratios and CIA population statistics)
* Cats in Belgium: 1.7 million according to Ian Traynor, &quot;Belgium Plans to Neuter Most Cats as the Feline Population Explodes,&quot; The Guardian (3 September 2010)
* Cats in Mexico: Approximately 13.5 million, according to the Alaska Department of Community and Economic Development Trends in the U.S. Pet Industry (2003)
* Cats in New Zealand: Up to 2 million, according to the New Zealand Government Department of Conservation

Few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organization (such as [[Canadian Federation of Humane Societies]]'s one &lt;ref name= Canadian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2012/07/17/nb-cat-census-1000.html |title=Humane society launches national cat census |accessdate=18 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the net,&lt;ref name = catsbe&gt;

==Feral cats==
{{Main|Feral cat}}
[[File:Feral cat Virginia crop.jpg|thumb|upright|American feral [[farm cat]]]]

[[Feral cat]]s are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; The numbers of feral cats are not known, but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large groups called [[feral cat colony|feral colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name=hsus-feral&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat | title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |publisher=Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php | title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. | accessdate=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely: ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed ''trap-neuter-return'', where the cats are trapped, [[neutering|neutered]], [[immunization|immunized]] against rabies and the [[feline leukemia virus]], and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark the feral as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespan is increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name=hsus-feral/&gt;

==History and mythology==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of cats|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 058.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian sculpture at the [[Louvre]]]]

Traditionally, historians tended to think that [[ancient Egypt]] was the site of cat domestication, owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old.&lt;ref name=Driscoll/&gt; However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave was excavated in [[Shillourokambos]], Cyprus, that contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline–human association significantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;9500 years&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the [[African wildcat]] (''Felis silvestris lybica''), rather than present-day domestic cats. This discovery, combined with genetic studies, suggest that cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East, in the [[Fertile Crescent]] around the time of the [[History of agriculture|development of agriculture]] and then they were brought to Cyprus and Egypt.&lt;ref name=Driscoll&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Driscoll CA, Menotti-Raymond M, Roca AL |title=The Near Eastern origin of cat domestication |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5837 |pages=519–23 |year=2007 |pmid=17600185 |doi=10.1126/science.1139518|bibcode = 2007Sci...317..519D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Egypt cats were [[animal worship|sacred animal]]s, with the goddess [[Bastet]] often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the warlike aspect of a lioness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mason |first=I.

[[File:Freya by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Freyja]] and her cats]]
Several ancient religions believed that cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that they are all-knowing but are mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the ''[[maneki neko]]'' is a cat that is a symbol of good fortune. Although there are no sacred species in Islam, some writers have stated that [[Muhammad]] had a favorite cat, [[Muezza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Geyer |first=Georgie Anne |title=When Cats Reigned Like Kings: On the Trail of the Sacred Cats |publisher=Andrews McMeel |location=Kansas City, Missouri |year=2004 |ISBN=0-7407-4697-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have loved cats so much that &quot;he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reeves&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Minou Reeves|title=Muhammad in Europe|publisher=New York University (NYU) Press|page=52|isbn=0-8147-7533-0|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freyja]]—the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility in [[Norse mythology]]—is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.

Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] &quot;crossing your path&quot; leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]] is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).{{citation}}

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Germany and some Spanish-speaking regions they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959|date=7 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010|author=Nora Sugobono|language=Spanish|title=Las vidas del gato|publisher=El Comercio}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian |location=London |location=UK|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|accessdate=18 March 2010|author=Tim Dowling|title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.best-cat-art.com/cat-myths.html |title=Cat Myths, Misinformation and Untruths |first=Rosina |last=Wachtmeister |work=Best-Cat-Art.com |year=2008 |publisher=self-published |accessdate=22 November 2008}}{{self-published source|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around.

[[File:Trillium Poncho cat dog.jpg|thumb|A [[cat]] and [[dog]], the two most popular pets]]

A '''pet''' is a household [[animal]] kept for [[companionship]] and a person's enjoyment, as opposed to [[livestock]], [[laboratory animal]]s, [[working animal]]s and [[sport animal]]s which are kept for economic reasons.  The most popular pets are noted for their attractive appearances and their loyal or playful personalities. Their pedigree may also be a factor. 

In some cases pets may also provide their owners with benefits, such as providing companionship to elderly adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1987/1987HealthBenefitsPetsta003html.htm | title=The Health Benefits of Pets | publisher=US Government National Institute of Health | accessdate=2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiman|first=Steve|title=Therapy Dogs in the Long-Term Health Care Environment|url=http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some people believe in the physical and emotional benefits of owning a pet, scientists are currently working to verify these ideas with [[medical studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1987/1987HealthBenefitsPetsta003html.htm | title=The Health Benefits of Pets | publisher=US Government National Institute of Health | accessdate=2006-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is now a medically-approved class of &quot;therapy animals,&quot; mostly dogs, that are brought to visit confined humans. ''Pet therapy'' utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive, and emotional goals with patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farlex|title=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pet+Therapy|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walking a [[dog]] can provide both the owner and the dog with exercise, fresh air, and social interaction.

The most popular pets are [[dogs]] and [[cats]], but there are also [[rodent]] pets, such as [[gerbils]], [[hamsters]], [[chinchillas]], [[fancy rat]]s, and [[guinea pigs]]; [[avian]] pets, such as [[Domestic Canary|canaries]], [[parakeets]], and [[parrots]]; reptile pets, such as [[turtles]], [[lizards]] and [[snakes]]; and [[aquarium|aquatic pets]], such as [[tropical fish]] and [[frogs]].

The keeping of animals as pets can raise concerns in regard to [[animal welfare]]. In particular, overpopulation is cited as a problem, as is the breeding and treatment of animals.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.peta.org/about/why-peta/pets.aspx Animal Rights Uncompromised: 'Pets']&quot;, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]. Retrieved September 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, people can view the keeping of animals as akin to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Meng |first=Jenia |year=2009 |title=Origins of attitudes towards animals Ultravisum |degree=Ph.D.|publisher=[[University of Queensland]] |location=Brisbane |isbn=978-0-9808425-1-7 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local restrictions==
Many cities and towns have local ordinances limiting the number of pets a person may have, although a certain number of animals may be kept for business purposes. They may also restrict or forbid certain pets, such as exotics. [[Breed-specific legislation|Certain breeds]] of dog, such as the [[pit bull]] and the [[Rottweiler]], are banned in some places. [[Canid hybrid]]s, created by breeding dogs with other members of the canine family, may be banned in some places. Semi-exotic cats, such as the [[Savannah cat|Savannah]], are also banned in some locations.

In many locations, animals that are considered pets by their owners but are legally classified as [[livestock]], including [[horses]], [[pigs]], [[camelid]]s, and fowl may be banned from being kept within the city limits or restricted to property of a certain larger size.

The cities of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]], have passed laws stating that people who have pets do not &quot;own&quot; them; rather, they are the pet's &quot;guardian.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

[[Condominium]] associations and rental properties often limit or forbid pets ownership by their tenants.

==Pet popularity==
There are approximately 78.2 million pet dogs in the United States, and approximately 86.4 million pet cats in the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;Humane Society&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=The Humane Society of the United States|title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two most popular pets in most Western countries have been cats and dogs. In the United States, a 2007-2008 survey showed that dog-owning households outnumbered those owning cats, but that the total number of pet cats was higher than that of dogs. The same was true for 2009-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s1227.xls | title=Household Pet Ownership: 2001 | publisher=US Census Bureau | accessdate=2007-09-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of a pet==
For a small to medium-size dog, the total cost over a dog's lifetime is about $7,240 to $12,700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lieber|first=Alex|title=Lifetime Costs of Dog Ownership|url=http://www.petplace.com/dogs/lifetime-costs-of-dog-ownership/page1.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an indoor cat, the total cost over a cat's lifetime is about $8,620 to $11,275.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lieber|first=Alex|title=Lifetime Costs of Cat Ownership|url=http://www.petplace.com/cats/lifetime-costs-of-cat-ownership/page1.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People most commonly get pets for companionship, to protect a home or property, or because of the beauty or attractiveness of the animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;leslie&quot;/&gt; The most common reasons for not owning a pet are lack of time, lack of suitable housing, and lack of ability to care for the pet when traveling.&lt;ref name=&quot;leslie&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | pmc = 1686751 | pmid = 8076276 | year = 1994 | month= April| author = Leslie, Be; Meek, Ah; Kawash, Gf; Mckeown, Db | title = An epidemiological investigation of pet ownership in Ontario | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–22 | issn = 0008-5286 | journal = The Canadian veterinary journal.

===Canada===
The latest survey done by Colin Siren of Ipsos Reid estimates that there are 7.9 million cats and 5.9 million dogs in Canada. The survey also shows that 35% of Canadian households have a dog, while 38% have a cat, which is consistent with other surveys conducted around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.aaaht.com/members/documents/PressRelease-PetSurvey-November15.pdf |format=PDF| title= Latest Pet Population Figures Released | publisher=Canadian Animal Health Institute | accessdate=2008-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
A 2007 survey by the [[University of Bristol]] found that 26% of UK households owned cats and 31% owned dogs, estimating total domestic populations of
approximately 10.3 million cats and 10.5 million dogs in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2010/6826.html |title=UK domestic cat and dog population larger than thought |date=6 February 2010 |publisher=[[University of Bristol]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47.2% of households with a cat had at least one person educated to degree level, compared with 38.4% of homes with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8501042.stm |title=More cat owners 'have degrees' than dog-lovers  |date=6 February 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overpopulation==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Overpopulation in companion animals}}
Animal protection advocates call attention to pet overpopulation in the United States. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that animal shelters care for 6-8 million dogs and cats every year in the United States, of whom approximately 3-4 million are euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Humane Society of The United States|title=Common Questions about Animal Shelters|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/resources/qa/common_questions_on_shelters.html#How_many_animals_enter_animal_shelters_e|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation is created by nonneutered (non-[[spayed]]/[[castrated]]) animals reproducing and people intentionally breeding animals.  A particularly problematic combination of economic hardship combined with a love of animals contributes to this problem in parts of the rural United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2007-06-30 | accessdate = 2007-06-30
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also major overpopulation problems with other pet species, such as birds and rabbits. Local humane societies, [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (SPCAs), and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from [[animal shelter]]s instead of purchasing them from breeders or [[pet store]]s.

==Effects on pets' health==

Keeping animals as pets may become detrimental to their health if certain requirements are not kept. An important issue is inappropriate feeding, which may produce clinical effects (like the consumption of [[chocolate]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mason Woods|first=Elizabeth|title=Toxic and Dangerous Foods for Pets|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/pet-health/dangerous-foods-for-your-pet.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by dogs). Among the foods that can be toxic to pets, are: avocados, alcohol, candy, caffeine, grapes and raisins, nuts, and onions.&lt;ref name=aspca-foods&gt;{{cite web|title=People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/people-foods.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2012|author=American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passive smoking is dangerous for pets. Researchers have found that exposure to tobacco smoke has been associated with certain cancers in dogs and cats and allergies in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Americans for Nonsmokers Rights|title=Tobacco, Secondhand Smoke, and Pets|url=http://www.no-smoke.org/learnmore.php?id=623|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of pets on their caregiver's health==
=== Health benefits ===
Pets have the ability to stimulate their caregivers, in particular the elderly, giving people someone to take care of, someone to exercise with, and someone to help them heal from a physically or psychologically troubled past.&lt;ref name=&quot;whiteley&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Whiteley|first=Ellen H.|title=The Healing Power of Pets|publisher=Saturday Evening Post|volume=258|issue=7|year=1986|pages=2–102|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=afh&amp;AN=12592944&amp;site=ehost-live}} Academic Search Elite.

Dogs that are trained in the field of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) can also benefit people with disabilities.

===Pets in long-term care institutions===
Even pet owners residing in a long-term care facility, such as a hospice or nursing home, experience health benefits from pets. Pets help people cope with the emotional issues related to their illness. They also offer physical contact with another living creature, something that is often missing in an elder's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reinman|first=Steve|title=Therapy Dogs in the Long-Term Health Care Environment|url=http://www.therapydogs.org/documents/Therapy%20Dogs%20in%20the%20Long.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pets for nursing homes are chosen based on the size of the pet, the amount of care that the breed needs, and the population and size of the care institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;whiteley&quot;/&gt; Appropriate pets go through a screening process and, if it is a dog, additional training programs to become a [[therapy dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huculak|first=Chad|title=Super Furry Animals|journal=Edmonton|date=4 October 2006|page=W7}}.

===Health risks===
Health risks that are associated with pets include:
* Aggravation of [[allergy|allergies]] and [[asthma]] caused by [[dander]] and [[fur]] or [[feather]]s
* [[Falling (accident)|Falling injuries]].  Tripping over pets, especially dogs, causes more than 86,000 falls serious enough to prompt a trip to the emergency room each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among elderly and disabled people, these falls have resulted in life-threatening injuries and broken bones.
* Injuries, maulings and sometimes deaths caused by pet bites and attacks
* Disease and/or parasites due to animal hygiene problems or lack of appropriate treatment (faeces and urine)
* Stress caused by behaviour of animals
* Fear or distress from animal presence or behaviour

While many people have kept many different species of animals in captivity over the course of human history, only a relative few have been kept long enough to be considered [[domesticated]].  Other types of animals, notably [[monkey]]s, have never been domesticated but are still commonly sold and kept as pets.  There are also inanimate objects that have been kept as &quot;pets&quot;, either as a form of game, or humorously (e.g. the [[pet rock]]).

===Domesticated===
Domesticated pets are the most common types of pet.  A ''domesticated animal'' is any animal that has been tamed and made fit for a human environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farlex|title=The Free Dictionary by Farlex|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/domestic+animal|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have consistently been kept in captivity over a long enough period of time that they exhibit marked differences in behavior and appearance from their wild relatives.

Some species listed here may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as [[domesticated]].  Many of these pets, like insects and fish, are kept as a hobby, rather than for companionship.

A '''mouse''' (plural: '''mice''') is a small [[mammal]] belonging to the order of [[rodent]]s, characteristically having a pointed snout, small rounded ears, and a long naked or almost hairless tail. The best known mouse species is the common [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''). It is also a popular [[pet]]. In some places, certain kinds of [[Apodemus|field mice]] are also common. This rodent is eaten by large birds such as hawks and eagles. They are known to invade homes for food and occasionally shelter.

The American [[white-footed mouse]] (''Peromyscus leucopus'') and the ''deer mouse'' (''[[Peromyscus maniculatus]]''), as well as other common species of mouse-like rodents around the world, also sometimes live in houses. These, however, are in other [[genus|genera]].

[[Cat]]s, wild [[dog]]s, [[fox]]es, [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[snake]]s and even certain kinds of [[arthropod]]s have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of its remarkable adaptability to almost any [[ecological niche|environment]], the mouse is one of the most successful [[mammalian]] genera living on [[Earth]] today.

Mice can at times be [[vermin]], damaging and eating [[Crop (agriculture)|crops]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Leirs H|title=The Year of the Rat ends: time to fight hunger!|journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=65 |issue=4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1002/ps.1718 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121686000/abstract |pmid=19206089 |pages=351–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing structural damage and spreading [[disease]]s through their [[parasite]]s and [[feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A|title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|url=http://www.informahealthcare.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408410902989837 |pmid=19548807 |pages=221–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to [[hantavirus]], which may lead to Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS).

Mice and rats are the most commonly used animals for laboratory tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1845956812.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=May+14%2C+1981&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Sun+%281837-1985%29&amp;desc=Hopkins+thalidomide+research+results+in+new+drug+test&amp;pqatl=google | first=Mary | last=Knudson | title=Hopkins thalidomide research results in new drug test | date=1981-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Day-old mice.JPG|right|thumb|1 day old pups]]
Breeding onset is at about 50 days of age in both females and males, although females may have their first [[estrus]] at 25–40 days. Mice are polyestrous and breed year round; ovulation is spontaneous. The duration of the [[estrous cycle]] is 4–5 days and estrus itself lasts about 12 hours, occurring in the evening. Vaginal smears are useful in timed matings to determine the stage of the estrous cycle. Mating is usually nocturnal and may be confirmed by the presence of a [[copulatory plug]] in the vagina up to 24 hours post-copulation. The presence of sperm on a vaginal smear is also a reliable indicator of mating.&lt;ref name=lvma /&gt;

Female mice housed together tend to go into anestrus and do not cycle. If exposed to a male mouse or the pheromones of a male mouse, most of the females will go into estrus in about 72 hours. This synchronization of the estrous cycle is known as the [[Whitten effect]]. The exposure of a recently bred mouse to the pheromones of a strange male mouse may prevent implantation (or [[pseudopregnancy]]), a phenomenon known as the [[Bruce effect]].&lt;ref name=lvma/&gt;

The average gestation period is 20 days. A fertile [[postpartum estrus]] occurs 14–24 hours following [[parturition]], and simultaneous lactation and gestation prolongs gestation 3–10 days owing to delayed implantation. The average [[litter (animal)|litter]] size is 10–12 during optimum production, but is highly strain-dependent. As a general rule, [[inbred]] mice tend to have longer gestation periods and smaller litters than outbred and hybrid mice. The young are called pups and weigh {{convert|0.5|-|1.5|g|abbr=on}} at birth, are hairless, and have closed eyelids and ears. Cannibalism is uncommon, but females should not be disturbed during parturition and for at least 2 days postpartum. Pups are weaned at 3 weeks of age; weaning weight is {{convert|10|-|12|g|abbr=on}}. If the postpartum estrus is not utilized, the female resumes cycling 2–5 days post-weaning.&lt;ref name=lvma/&gt;

Newborn male mice are distinguished from newborn females by noting the greater [[anogenital distance]] and larger [[genital papilla]] in the male. This is best accomplished by lifting the tails of [[littermate]]s and comparing [[perineum]]s.&lt;ref name=lvma/&gt;

== Laboratory mice ==
{{Main|Laboratory mice}}
[[File:PCWmice1.jpg|thumb|[[Knockout mouse|
Knockout mice]]]]

Mice are common [[experiment]]al animals in [[biology]] and [[psychology]] primarily because they are mammals, and also because they share a high degree of [[homology (biology)|homology]] with humans. They are the most commonly used [[mammal]]ian [[model organism]], more common than [[rats]]. The mouse [[genome]] has been sequenced, and virtually all mouse [[gene]]s have human homologs. They can also be manipulated in ways that would be considered unethical to do with humans (note [[Animal Rights]]). A '''[[knockout mouse]]''' is a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] [[mus musculus|mouse]] that has had one or more of its genes made inoperable through a [[gene knockout]].

There are other reasons why mice are used in laboratory research. Mice are small, inexpensive, easily maintained, and can reproduce quickly. Several [[generation]]s of mice can be observed in a relatively short period of time. Mice are generally very docile if raised from birth and given sufficient human contact. However, certain strains have been known to be quite temperamental. Mice and rats have the same organs in the same places, just different proportions.

== Subgenera ==
[[File:Mouse vermin02.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Apodemus|Field mouse]] of the subgenus [[Mus (subgenus)|Mus]].]]

All members of the ''Mus'' genus are referred to as mice. However, the term ''mouse'' can also be applied to species outside of this genus. ''Mouse'' often refers to any small muroid rodent, while ''[[rat]]'' refers to larger muroid rodents. Therefore these terms are not [[taxonomy|taxonomically]] specific. For simplicity, only the rodent [[subgenus|subgenera]] belonging to the ''Mus'' genus are listed here.

Genus '''''Mus''''' - Typical mice
*Subgenus ''[[Coelomys]]'' ([[East Asia]])
*Subgenus ''[[Mus (subgenus)|Mus]]'' ([[Eurasia]] to [[North Africa]], except for the [[house mouse]] which is worldwide.)
*Subgenus ''[[Nannomys]]'' ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]])
*Subgenus ''[[Pyromys]]'' ([[East Asia]])
*Subgenus and species ''[[Mus lepidoides]]''

== As pets ==
[[File:Fancy_mice.jpg|thumb|250px|Pet mice]]
{{Main|Fancy mouse}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
Many people buy mice as companion pets. They can be playful, loving and can grow used to being handled. Like pet rats, pet mice should not be left unsupervised outside as they have many natural predators, including (but not limited to) birds, lizards, cats, and dogs. Male mice tend to have a stronger odor than the females.  However, mice are careful groomers and as pets they never need bathing.  Well looked after mice can make ideal pets. Some common mouse care products are:
* [[Fancy mouse#Caging|Cage]] – Usually a [[hamster]] or [[gerbil]] [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]], but special mouse cages are now available.
* [[mouse food|Food]] – Special pelleted and seed-based food is available. Mice can generally eat most rodent food (for rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, etc.)
* Bedding – Usually made of hardwood pulp, such as [[aspen]], sometimes from shredded, un[[ink]]ed [[paper]] or recycled virgin [[wood pulp]]. Using [[corn husk]] bedding is avoided because it promotes ''Aspergillis'' [[fungus]], and can grow [[mold]] once it gets wet, which is rough on their feet.

== Nutrition ==
In nature, mice are largely [[herbivore]]s, consuming any kind of fruit or grain from plants.&lt;ref name=ecodome&gt;[http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/MarsSim/SimHTML/organisms/mouse.html Mouse: Northwestern University Ecodome Information Page]&lt;/ref&gt; However, mice adapt well to urban areas and are known for eating almost all types of food scraps. In captivity, mice are commonly fed commercial pelleted mouse diet. These diets are nutritionally complete, but they still need a large variety of vegetables. Food intake is approximately {{convert|15|g|abbr=on}} per {{convert|100|g|abbr=on}} of body weight per day; water intake is approximately {{convert|15|ml|abbr=on}} per 100 g of body weight per day.&lt;ref name=lvma&gt;[http://www.lvma.org/mouse.html Louisiana Veterinary Medical Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

== As food ==
[[File:Feeder mice.jpg|250px|thumb|&quot;Pinkie&quot; mice for sale as [[reptile]] food]]
Mice are a staple in the diet of many small [[carnivores]].  Humans have eaten mice since [[prehistoric]] times and still eat them as a delicacy throughout eastern [[Zambia]] and northern [[Malawi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.bridgewater.edu/~mtembo/mbeba.html | title=Mice as a Delicacy: the Significance of Mice in the Diet of the Tumbuka People of Eastern Zambia | first=Mwizenge S. | last=Tembo | accessdate=2008-08-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080623091951/http://www.bridgewater.edu/~mtembo/mbeba.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are a seasonal source of [[protein]]. Mice are no longer routinely consumed by humans elsewhere.

In various countries mice are used as food&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reptilesinc.com.au/shopshow.toy?animalnid=733911&amp;categorynid=25726 Food - Frozen mice &amp; rats], Canberra Exotic Pets / reptilesinc.com.au, accessed 2009-11-14&lt;/ref&gt; for pets such as [[snakes]], [[lizards]], [[frogs]], [[tarantulas]] and [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], and many pet stores carry mice for this purpose. Some countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, have banned the practice of feeding live mice, citing ethical concerns regarding both predator and prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animalhospitals-usa.com/reptiles/snake_feeding.html | title=Snake feeding: Rodents, Food infections, Feeding Schedule | accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common terms used to refer to different ages/sizes of mice when sold for pet food are &quot;pinkies&quot;, &quot;fuzzies&quot;, &quot;crawlers&quot;, &quot;hoppers&quot;, and &quot;adults&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.southfloridarodents.com/ | title=South Florida's True Rodent Professionals | accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkies are newborn mice that have not yet grown fur; fuzzies have some fur but are not very mobile; hoppers have a full coat of hair and are fully mobile but are smaller than adult mice. Mice without fur are easier for the animal to consume; however, mice with fur may be more convincing as animal feed. These terms are also used to refer to the various growth stages of [[rat]]s (see [[Fancy rat]]).

==Use for sense of smell==
Israeli scientists have tested mice as a new form of airport security detector. It consists of three concealed cartridges, each containing eight specially trained mice. If they sense traces of explosives or drugs, they will trigger the alarm. According to the New Scientist, the mice work four-hour shifts and are more accurate than using dogs or x-ray machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/8300223/Mice-trained-for-airport-security.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mice trained for airport security | date=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tom and Jerry''''' is  a series of theatrical [[animated cartoon]] films created by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], centering on a never-ending rivalry between a [[cat]] ([[Tom Cat|Tom]]) and a [[mouse]] ([[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]]) whose chases and battles often involved comic violence (despite this they sometimes become allies to defeat a 'greater enemy' such as Spike the dog). Hanna and Barbera ultimately wrote, produced and directed 114 ''Tom and Jerry'' [[short subject|short]]s  at the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]] in [[Hollywood]] between [[1940 in film|1940]] and [[1957 in film|1957]], when the animation unit was closed. The original series is notable for having won the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]] seven times, tying it with  [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' as the theatrical animated series with the most [[Oscars]]. A longtime television staple, ''Tom and Jerry'' has a worldwide audience that consists of children, teenagers and adults, and has also been recognized as one of the most famous and longest-lived rivalries in American cinema. In 2000, ''[[TIME]]'' named the series one of the greatest television shows of all time.

Beginning in 1960, in addition to the original 114 Hanna-Barbera cartoons, MGM had new shorts produced by [[Rembrandt Films]], led by [[Gene Deitch]] in Eastern Europe. Production of Tom and Jerry shorts returned to Hollywood under [[Chuck Jones]]'s [[Sib-Tower 12 Productions]] in 1963; this series lasted until 1967, making it a total of 161 shorts. The cat and mouse stars later resurfaced in television cartoons produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and [[Filmation Studios]] during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; a feature film, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'', in 1992 (released domestically in 1993); and in 2001, their first made-for TV short, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat]]'' for [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]. The most recent Tom and Jerry theatrical short ''[[The Karate Guard]]'' (2005), was written and co-directed by Barbera.

Today, [[Time Warner]] (via its [[Turner Entertainment]] division) owns the rights to Tom and Jerry (with [[Warner Bros.]] handling distribution). Since the merger, Turner has produced the series ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' for [[The CW]]'s [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] &quot;[[The CW4Kids]]&quot; lineup, and a string of Tom and Jerry direct-to-video films — all in collaboration with [[Warner Bros. Animation]].

==Plot and format==
{{Section OR|date=February 2011}} 
The series features comedic fights between an iconic set of enemies, a house cat and mouse. The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and destruction that ensues. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. Despite this, there are also several instances within the cartoons where they display genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. Other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escaped the watch of a negligent teen babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger.

The cartoons are infamous for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation, such as Jerry slicing Tom in half, shutting his head in a window or a door, Tom using everything from [[axe]]s, firearms, [[explosives]], [[trap (tactic)|traps]] and [[poison]] to try to [[murder]] Jerry, Jerry stuffing Tom's tail in a [[waffle iron]] and a [[Mangle (machine)|mangle]], kicking him into a [[refrigerator]], plugging his [[tail]] into an [[electric socket]], pounding him with a [[Mace (club)|mace]], [[Club (weapon)|club]] or [[mallet]], causing a [[tree]] or an electric pole to drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyTeleL&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Master cartoonist who created Tom and Jerry draws his last|last=Whitworth |first=Melissa |date=2006-12-20|work=The Daily Telegraph (LONDON)|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, ''Tom and Jerry'' has often been criticized as excessively violent. Despite the frequent violence, there is no blood or gore in any scene. &lt;ref name=&quot;Sennett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|coauthors=Joseph Barbera, with Ted Sennett|title=The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity|year=1989|publisher=Viking Studio Books|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-670-82978-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoodin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smoodin|first=Eric|title=Cartoon and Comic Classicism: High-Art Histories of Lowbrow Culture|journal=American Literary History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|volume=4|issue=1 (Spring, 1992)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134}} 

[[Music]] plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director [[Scott Bradley]] created complex scores that combined elements of [[jazz]], classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs, as well as songs from MGM films, including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 movie)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Meet Me In St. Louis]]''. Generally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters are able to speak English on rare occasions and are thus not mute. For example, the character [[Mammy Two Shoes]] has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.

Before 1954, all ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were produced in the standard [[Academy ratio]] and format; in 1954 and 1955, some of the output was dually produced in dual versions: one Academy-ratio negative composed for a flat [[widescreen]] (1.75:1) format and one shot in the [[CinemaScope]] process. From 1955 until the close of the MGM cartoon studio a year later, all ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were produced in CinemaScope, some even had their soundtracks recorded in [[Perspecta|Perspecta directional audio]].  All of the Hanna and Barbera cartoons were shot as successive color exposure negatives and printed by [[Technicolor]]; the 1960s entries were done in [[Metrocolor]].

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Tom and Jerry characters}}

===Tom Cat and Jerry Mouse===
{{Main|Tom Cat |Jerry Mouse}}
[[Image:FlyingSorceress3.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Cat]]

[[Tom Cat|Tom]] (called &quot;Jasper&quot; in his debut appearance) is a blue and white domestic shorthair [[cat]]. He usually lives a pampered life, although the characters usually live in several lifestyles, while [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] is a small brown [[house mouse]] who always lives in close proximity to him. &quot;Tom&quot; is a generic name for a male cat (The ''[[Warner Bros.]]'' cartoon character [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]] was originally named Thomas).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Jerry possesses surprising strength for his size, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts with them. Despite the typical cat-eats-mouse scenario, it is surprisingly quite rare for Tom to actually try and consume Jerry. Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry. Despite being very energetic and determined, Tom is no match for Jerry's brains and wits. By the final &quot;fade-out&quot; of each cartoon, Jerry usually emerges triumphant, while Tom is shown as the loser. However, other results may be reached; on rare occasions, Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or when he crosses some sort of line (the best example of which occurs in [[The Million Dollar Cat]] where, after finding out that Tom's newly acquired wealth will be taken away if he harms any animal, including a mouse, he torments Tom until Tom finally loses his temper and attacks him). Sometimes, usually ironically, they both lose, usually when Jerry's last trap potentially backfires on him after it affects Tom (An example is in Chuck Jones' [[Filet Meow]] short where Jerry orders a shark to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterwards, the shark scares Jerry away as well) or when Jerry overlooks something at the end of the course. Sometimes, they both end up being friends (only for something to happen so that Tom will chase Jerry again). Both characters display [[Sadism and masochism|sadistic]] tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other. However, depending on the cartoon, whenever one character appears to be in mortal danger (in a dangerous situation or by a third party), the other will develop a conscience and save him. Sometimes, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks. Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty, and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to [[torture]] and humiliate them both. Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary. (Example is when in [[Posse Cat]], when Jerry decides to pretend to get chased by Tom in exchange for half his food. Tom agrees to this, but then he goes back on his word later.) Other times however, Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved. 

Tom changes his love interest many times. The first love interest is Toots who appears in ''[[Puss n' Toots]]'', and calls him &quot;Tommy&quot; in ''[[The Mouse Comes to Dinner]]''.  He is also interested in a cat called Toots in ''[[The Zoot Cat]]'' although she has a different appearance to the original Toots. The most frequent love interest of Tom's is [[Toodles Galore]], who never has any dialogue in the cartoons.

Despite five shorts ending with a depiction of Tom's apparent death, his demise is never permanent; he even reads about his own death in a flashback in [[Jerry's Diary]]. He appears to die in explosions in [[Mouse Trouble]] (after which he is seen in [[heaven]]), [[Yankee Doodle Mouse]] and in [[Safety Second]], while in [[The Two Mouseketeers]] he is guillotined offscreen.

====Tom and Jerry speaking====
Although many supporting and minor characters speak, Tom and Jerry rarely do so themselves. Tom, most famously, sings while wooing female cats; for example, Tom sings [[Louis Jordan]]'s &quot;[[Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby]]&quot; in the 1946 short ''[[Solid Serenade]]''. In a couple{{Quantify|date=January 2012}} of shorts, Tom, when romancing a female cat, woos her in a French-accented voice similar to that of screen actor [[Charles Boyer]]. At the end of [[The Million Dollar Cat]] after beginning to antagonize Jerry he says &quot;Gee, I'm throwin' away a million dollars... BUT I'M HAPPY!&quot; In ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring]]'', Jerry says, &quot;No, no, no, no, no,&quot; when choosing the shop to remove his ring. In ''[[The Mouse Comes to Dinner]]'' Tom speaks to his girlfriend while inadvertently sitting on a stove: &quot;Gee, what's cookin'?&quot; (The girl replies &quot;You are, stupid&quot;).  Another instance of speech comes in ''[[Solid Serenade]]'' and ''[[The Framed Cat]]'', where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner. In ''[[Mouse Trouble]]'', Tom says &quot;Don't you believe it!&quot; after being beaten up by Jerry (this also happens in ''[[The Missing Mouse]]''.) Co-director William Hanna provided most of the squeaks, gasps, and other vocal effects for the pair, including the most famous sound effects from the series, Tom's leather-lunged scream (created by recording Hanna's scream and eliminating the beginning and ending of the recording, leaving only the strongest part of the scream on the soundtrack) and Jerry's nervous gulp. The only other reasonably common vocalization is made by Tom when some external reference claims a certain scenario or eventuality to be impossible, which inevitably, ironically happens to thwart Tom's plans - at which point, a bedraggled and battered Tom appears and says in a haunting, echoing voice &quot;Don't you believe it!&quot;, a reference to some famous World War II [[propaganda]] shorts of the 1940s {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}. In the 1946 short ''[[Trap Happy]]'', Tom hires [[Butch (Tom and Jerry)|a mouse exterminator]] who, after several failed attempts to dispatch Jerry, changes profession to ''Cat'' exterminator by crossing out the &quot;Mouse&quot; on his title and writing &quot;Cat&quot;, resulting in Tom spelling out the word out loud before reluctantly pointing at himself.  One short, 1956's ''[[Blue Cat Blues]]'', is narrated by Jerry in [[voiceover]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) as they try to win back their ladyfriends. Both Tom and Jerry speak more than once in the 1943 short ''[[The Lonesome Mouse]]''. ''Tom and Jerry: The Movie'' is the first (and so far only) installment of the series where the famous cat-and-mouse duos regularly speak. In that movie, Tom was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] and Jerry was voiced by [[Dana Hill]].

===Spike and Tyke===
{{Main|Spike and Tyke (characters)}}
[[Image:Love That Pup2.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Spike and his son Tyke]]
In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike (known as &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Butch&quot; in some episodes), an angry, vicious but extremely dumb guard [[American Bulldog|bulldog]] who tries to attack Tom for bothering his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute (aside from howls and biting noises) as well as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions (performed by [[Billy Bletcher]] and later [[Daws Butler]]) modeled after comedian [[Jimmy Durante]]. Spike's coat has altered throughout the years between grey and creamy tan. The addition of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series (''[[Spike and Tyke]]''). 

Most cartoons with Spike in it have a system; usually Spike is trying to accomplish something (such as building a dog house or sleeping) when Tom and Jerry's antics stop him from doing it, Spike then (presumably due to prejudice) singles out Tom as the culprit and threatens him that if it ever happens again, he will do &quot;something horrible&quot; to him (effectively forcing Tom to take the blame of anyone else) while Jerry overhears, afterwards Jerry usually does anything he can to interrupt whatever Spike is doing while Tom barely manages to stop him (usually getting injured in the process), usually Jerry does eventually wreck whatever Spike is doing in spectacular fashion and leaving Tom to take the blame, forcing him to flee from Spike and inevitably lose (usually due to the fact that Tom is usually framed by Jerry and that Spike just doesn't like Tom) off-screen, Spike does something to Tom and finally Tom is generally shown injured or in a bad situation while Jerry smugly cuddles up to Spike unscathed. At least once however, Tom does something that benefits Spike, who promises not to interfere ever again; causing Jerry to frantically leave the house and run into the distance (in [[Hic-cup Pup]]). Spike is well known for his famous &quot;''Listen pussycat!''&quot; catchphrase when he threatens Tom, his other famous catchphrase is &quot;''That's my boy!''&quot; normally said when he supports or congratulates his son.

Tyke is described as a cute, sweet looking, happy and a lovable puppy. He is Spike's son, but unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates (mostly towards his father) by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling. Tyke's father Spike would always go out of his way to care and comfort his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son and they get along like friends, although most of time they would be taking a nap or Spike would teach Tyke the main facts of life of being a dog. Like Spike, Tyke's appearance has altered throughout the years, from grey (with white paws) to creamy tan. When [[Tom and Jerry Kids]] first aired, this was the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak.

===Butch and Toodles Galore===
{{Main|Butch (Tom and Jerry)|Toodles Galore}}
[[Image:PDVD 038.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Butch and Toodles Galore, in the 1946 ''Tom and Jerry'' short ''[[Springtime for Thomas]]''.]] 
Butch is a black cat who also wants to eat Jerry. He is the most frequent adversary of Tom. However, for most of the episodes he appears in, he's usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles. Butch was also Tom's pal or chum as in some cartoons, where Butch is leader of Tom's buddies, who are [[Meathead (Tom and Jerry)|Meathead]] and [[Topsy (Tom and Jerry)|Topsy]]. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most episodes.

===Nibbles===
{{main|Nibbles (Tom and Jerry)}}
Nibbles is a small grey mouse who often accompanies Jerry as an apprentice or student of sorts. He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry's command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. This can lead to such results as &quot;getting the cheese&quot; by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry's example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. Many times Nibbles is an ally of Jerry in fights against Tom, including being the second Mouseketeer. He is given speaking roles in all his appearances as a Mouseketeer, often with a high-pitched French tone. However, during an episode to rescue Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.

==History and evolution==
&quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; was a commonplace phrase for youngsters indulging in riotous behaviour in 19th-century London. The term comes from ''Life in London, or Days and Nights of Jerry Hawthorne and his elegant friend Corinthian Tom'' (1823) by [[Pierce Egan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=2|year=1989|chapter=Tom and Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Brewer]]  notes no more than an &quot;unconscious&quot; echo of the Regency-era original in the naming of the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahon|first1=Seán|last2=O'Donoghue|first2=Jo|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase &amp; Fable|year=2004|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson|location=London|isbn=978-0-304-36334-6|page=799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanna-Barbera era (1940–1958)===
[[Image:PDVD 021.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Tom and Jerry'' creators / producers / directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, with the seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Awards for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] their ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts won.]]

[[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] were both part of the [[Rudolf Ising]] unit at the [[MGM cartoon studio]] in the late 1930s. After the financial disaster of the [[The Katzenjammer Kids|Captain and the Kids]] series, Barbera, a storyman and character designer, was paired (out of desperation) with Hanna, an experienced director, to start directing films for the Ising unit. In their first discussion for a cartoon, Joseph Barbera suggested Cat-and-Mouse cartoon entitled ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]''. &quot;We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought&quot;, as he recalled in an interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeonardMaltin&quot;&gt;Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera-1997&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna and many other employees complained that the idea wasn't very original; nevertheless, the short was completed in late 1939, and released to theaters on February 10, 1940. ''Puss Gets The Boot'' centers on Jasper, a gray tabby cat trying to catch a mouse named Jinx (whose name is not mentioned), but after accidentally breaking a houseplant and its stand, the African American housemaid Mammy (later Tom's owner) has threatened to throw Jasper out if he breaks one more thing in the house. Naturally, Jinx uses this to his advantage, and begins tossing [[wine glass]]es, [[Plate (dishware)|ceramic plate]]s, [[teapot]]s, and any and everything fragile, so that Jasper will be thrown outside. ''Puss Gets The Boot'' was previewed and released without fanfare, and Hanna and Barbera went on to direct other (non-cat-and-mouse related) shorts such as [[Gallopin' Gals]] (1940) and [[Officer Pooch]] (1941). &quot;After all,&quot; remarked many of the MGM staffers, &quot;haven't there been enough cat-and-mouse cartoons already?&quot;

The pessimistic attitude towards the cat and mouse duo changed when the cartoon became a favorite with theater owners and with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], which nominated the film for the ''Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons'' of 1941. It lost to another MGM cartoon, Rudolph Ising's ''[[The Milky Way (1940 short film)|The Milky Way]]''.

Producer [[Fred Quimby]], who ran the MGM animation studio, quickly pulled Hanna and Barbera off the other one-shot cartoons they were working on, and commissioned a series featuring the cat and mouse. Hanna and Barbera held an intra-studio contest to give the pair a new name by drawing suggested names out of a hat; animator John Carr won $50 with his suggestion of ''Tom and Jerry''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarberaAutoBio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in &quot;Toons&quot;: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tom and Jerry'' series went into production with ''[[The Midnight Snack]]'' in 1941, and Hanna and Barbera rarely directed anything but the cat-and-mouse cartoons for the rest of their tenure at MGM. Barbera would create the story while Hanna would supervise production. 

Tom's physical appearance evolved significantly over the years. During the early 1940s, Tom had an excess of detail—shaggy fur, numerous facial [[wrinkle]]s, and multiple eyebrow markings, all of which were streamlined into a more workable form by the end of the 1940s—and looked like a realistic cat; in addition from his quadrupedal beginnings Tom became increasingly, and eventually almost exclusively, bipedal. By contrast, Jerry's design remained essentially the same for the duration of the series. By the mid-1940s, the series had developed a quicker, more energetic (and violent) tone, due to the inspiration from the work of their colleague in the MGM cartoon studio, [[Tex Avery]], who joined the studio in 1942.

Even though the theme of each short is virtually the same - cat chases mouse - Hanna and Barbera found endless variations on that theme. Barbera's storyboards and rough layouts and designs, combined with Hanna's timing, resulted in arguably MGM's most popular and successful cartoon series. Thirteen entries in the ''Tom and Jerry'' series (including ''Puss Gets The Boot'') were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons; seven of them went on to win the Academy Award, breaking the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney studio]]'s winning streak in that category. ''Tom and Jerry'' won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series.

''Tom and Jerry'' remained popular throughout their original theatrical run, even when the budgets began to tighten somewhat in the 1950s and the pace of the shorts slowed slightly. However, after [[television]] became popular in the 1950s, [[box office]] revenues decreased for theatrical films, and short subjects. At first, MGM combated this by going to all-CinemaScope production on the series. After MGM realized that their re-releases of the older cartoons brought in just as much money as the new cartoons did, the studio executives decided, much to the surprise of the staff, to close the animation studio. The MGM cartoon studio was shut down in 1957, and the final of the 114 Hanna-Barbera ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts, ''[[Tot Watchers]]'', was released on August 1, 1958. Hanna and Barbera established their own television animation studio, [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]], in 1957, which went on to produce famous TV shows and movies.

===Gene Deitch era (1961–1962)===
In 1960, MGM revived the ''Tom and Jerry'' franchise, and contacted European animation outfit [[Rembrandt Films]] to produce thirteen ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;cell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtfilms.com/buyraretom-jerry.html|title=Rare Tom &amp; Jerry Cell|publisher=[[Rembrandt Films]]|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Define&quot;&gt;Brion, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/108884830.html?dids=108884830:108884830&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+11%2C+1962&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Popeye%2C+Tom+%26+Jerry+Join+Trend+to+Shift+Production+Overseas&amp;pqatl=google|title=Popeye, Tom &amp; Jerry Join Trend to Shift Production Overseas|accessdate=2010-08-17|date=1962-06-11|author=MacDougall, Kent|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=American Animated Cartoons of the Vietnam Era: A Study of Social Commentary in Films and Television Programs, 1961–1973|author=P.

For the purposes of avoiding being linked to Communism, Deitch altered the names for his crew in the [[opening credits]] of the shorts (e.g., Štěpán Koníček became &quot;Steven Konichek&quot;, Václav Lídl became &quot;Victor Little&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt; These shorts are among the few ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons not to carry the &quot;Made In Hollywood, U.S.A.&quot; phrase at the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt; Due to Deitch's studio being behind the [[Iron Curtain]], the production studio's location is omitted entirely on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt; In the midst of production, Joe Vogel, the head of production, was fired from MGM, who ordered Deitch and his team to finish the shorts and rush them out to release.  The contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer expired,&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt; and the final of the thirteen shorts, ''[[Carmen Get It!]]'', was released on December 1, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Define&quot;/&gt; 
[[Image:Highsteaks.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Tom pokes Jerry in ''[[High Steaks]]'', one of the 13 films produced by the Deitch/Snyder team.]]

Since the Deitch/Snyder team had seen only a handful of the original ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts, and since Deitch and Snyder produced their cartoons on a tighter budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered unusual, and, in many ways, bizarre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Define&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt; The characters' gestures were often performed at high speed, frequently causing heavy motion blur. As a result, the animation of the characters looked choppy and sickly. The soundtracks featured sparse music, futuristic [[sound effects]], dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken, and heavy use of [[Reverberation|reverb]]. Fans that typically rooted for Tom criticized Deitch's cartoons for never having Tom become a threat to Jerry. Most of the time Tom only attempts to hurt him when he gets in his way. Tom's new owner, a corpulent and grumpy middle-aged white man (with serious temper problems, often going red in the face similar to Deitch's earlier &quot;Clint Clobber&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=chapter&amp;chapter=15a&amp;page=2&lt;/ref&gt; character at [[Terrytoons]]), was also more graphically brutal in punishing Tom's mistakes as compared to Mammy Two-Shoes, beating and thrashing Tom repeatedly, searing his face with a grill, and forcing Tom to drink an entire carbonated beverage. Despite this violence, the Gene Deitch ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons are still rerun today on the Cartoon Network and Boomerang channels on a semi-regular basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deitch&quot;/&gt;

Deitch's ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts have seen limited release outside of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]; all thirteen shorts are currently available in [[Japan]], where they have been ported to the ''Tom and Jerry &amp; Droopy'' [[laserdisc]] and VHS, and the [[United Kingdom]], where the shorts are available on the B-side of the ''Tom and Jerry: Classic Collection'' volume 5 DVD. The only short to have seen DVD release in the [[United States]] is ''[[The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit]]'', where it is included on the ''Paws for a Holiday'' DVD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratt&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Art, Adult, and More! – Volume 2 L–Z|author=Pratt, Douglas|isbn=1-932916-00-8|chapter=Tom and Jerry Paws for a Holiday (Warner, 65721)|page=1247|publisher=Douglas Pratt|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All thirteen shorts were commercial successes; in 1961, the ''Tom and Jerry'' series became the highest-grossing film series of all-time, dethroning the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series which had held the position for sixteen years; this success was repeated once more in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehman&quot;/&gt; However, unlike the Hanna and Barbera shorts, none of Deitch's films were nominated nor did they win an [[Academy Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehman&quot;/&gt; The episodes created by Deitch have generally been less favorably received by audiences. In his review for ''Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection'', Paul Kupperberg of Comicmix called the shorts &quot;perfectly dreadful&quot; and &quot;too often released&quot;, as well as a result of &quot;cheap labor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2009/06/21/review-tom-and-jerry-the-chuck-jones-collection-on-dvd/|title=Review: Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection|publisher=Comicmix.com|date=2009-06-21|author=Kupperberg, Paul|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deitch has frequently defended his films; in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'', when asked about working on the ''Tom and Jerry'' series, Deitch responded &quot;All the experts say [my shorts are] the worst of the 'Tom and Jerry', [...] I was a UPA man -- my whole background was much closer to the Czechs. 'Tom and Jerry' I always considered dreck, but they had great timing, facial expressions, double takes, squash and stretch,&quot; all of which the interviewer stated were &quot;techniques the Czechs had to learn,&quot; adding, &quot;The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;Nessel, Jen (1998-08-09). &quot;[http://www.fortheloveofprague.com/9_media.html ...a spicy, funny memoir!]&quot;.

===Chuck Jones era (1963–1967)===
[[File:TomandJerryTitleCardf.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Tom and Jerry'' title card for the [[Chuck Jones]] shorts.]]
After the last of the Deitch cartoons were released, [[Chuck Jones]], who had been fired from his thirty-plus year tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons, started his own animation studio, [[Sib Tower 12 Productions]], with partner Les Goldman. Beginning in 1963, Jones and Goldman went on to produce [[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection|34 more ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts]], all of which carried Jones' distinctive style (and a slight psychedelic influence). However, despite being animated by essentially the same artists who worked with Jones at Warners, these new shorts had varying degrees of critical success. 

Jones had trouble adapting his style to ''Tom and Jerry'''s brand of humor, and a number of the cartoons favored full animation, personality and style over storyline.  The characters underwent a slight change of appearance: Tom was given thicker [[eyebrow]]s (resembling Jones' [[Grinch]] or [[Count Blood Count]]), a less complex look (including the color of his fur becoming gray), sharper ears, and furrier cheeks, while Jerry was given larger eyes and ears, a lighter brown color, and a sweeter, [[Porky Pig]]-like expression. 

Some of Jones' ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons are reminiscent of his work with [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]], included the uses of [[blackout gag]]s and gags involving characters falling from high places. Jones co-directed the majority of the shorts with layout artist [[Maurice Noble]]. The remaining shorts were directed by [[Abe Levitow]] and [[Ben Washam]], with [[Tom Ray]] directing two shorts built around footage from earlier ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons directed by Hanna and Barbera, and Jim Pabian directed a short with Maurice Noble. Various vocal characteristics were made by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[June Foray]]. Jones' efforts are considered superior to the previous Deitch efforts (and most cartoons made during that time, albeit visually), and contain the memorable opening theme, in which Tom is trapped inside the &quot;O&quot; of his name.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;

Though Jones managed to recapture some of the magic from the original Hanna-Barbera efforts, MGM ended production on Tom and Jerry in 1967, by which time Sib Tower 12 had become [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]]. Jones had moved on to television specials and the feature film ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt;

===''Tom and Jerry'' hit television===
[[Image:PDVD 030.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The scenes featuring Mammy Two Shoes in ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]'' were pasted over with new scenes featuring a thin white teenager.]]

Beginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons began to appear on television in heavily edited form. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two-Shoes and remove her by pasting over the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat White Irish woman; occasionally, as in ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]'', a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by [[June Foray]]. However, recent telecasts on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by [[Thea Vidale]] to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks.

Debuting on [[CBS]]' Saturday morning schedule on September 25, 1965, ''Tom and Jerry'' moved to CBS Sundays two years later and remained there until September 17, 1972.

The intros of each episode shown on TV and DVD today are re-issues from the 1950s–1960s, with the exception of ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'' and ''[[The Night Before Christmas (1941 film)|The Night Before Christmas]]'', which still retain their original opening and closing credits from the early 1940s.

===Second Hanna-Barbera era: ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975–1977)===
In 1975, Tom and Jerry were reunited with Hanna and Barbera, who produced new ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (1975 TV series)|Tom and Jerry cartoons]]'' for Saturday mornings. These 48 seven-minute short cartoons were paired with ''[[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]]'' and ''[[The Mumbly Cartoon Show|Mumbly]]'' cartoons, to create ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (1975 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape Show]]'', ''[[Mumbly|The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show]]'', and ''[[Mumbly|The Tom and Jerry/Mumbly Show]]'', all of which initially ran on ABC Saturday Morning between September 6, 1975 and September 3, 1977.  In these cartoons, Tom and Jerry (now with a red bow tie), who had been enemies during their formative years, became nonviolent pals who went on adventures together, as Hanna-Barbera had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children's TV. ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' is still airing on the Canadian channel, [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]], and its classical counterpart, [[Teletoon Retro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=T.R.|coauthors=|title=Tom and Jerry: Fifty Years of Cat and Mouse|year=1991|publisher=Crescent Books|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-517-05688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmation era (1980–1982)===
[[Filmation|Filmation Studios]] (in association with [[MGM Television]]) also tried their hands at producing a ''Tom and Jerry'' TV series. Their version, ''[[The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show]]'', debuted in 1980, and also featured new cartoons starring [[Droopy]], Spike (another bulldog created by Tex Avery), and [[Barney Bear]], not seen since the original MGM shorts. The Filmation ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were noticeably different from Hanna-Barbera's efforts, as they returned ''Tom and Jerry'' to the original chase formula, with a somewhat more &quot;[[slapstick]]&quot; humor format. This incarnation, much like the 1975 version, was not as well received by [[audience]]s as the originals, and lasted on [[CBS]] Saturday Morning from September 6, 1980 to September 4, 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;50yrs&quot;/&gt; Its animation style bore a strong resemblance to that of ''[[The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle &amp; Jeckle]]''.

===''Tom and Jerry'''s new owners===
In 1986, MGM was purchased by [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]] founder [[Ted Turner]].  Turner sold the company a short while later, but retained MGM's pre-1986 film library, thus ''Tom and Jerry'' became the property of [[Turner Entertainment]] (where the rights stand today via [[Warner Bros.]]), and have in subsequent years appeared on Turner-run stations, such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]],  [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The WB Television Network|The WB]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], and [[Turner Classic Movies]].

===Third Hanna-Barbera era: ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990–1994)===
One of the biggest trends for Saturday morning television in the 1980s and 1990s was the [[Child versions of famous classic cartoon stars|&quot;babyfication&quot; of older, classic cartoon
stars]], and on March 2, 1990, ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry Kids|Tom and Jerry Kids]]'', co-produced by Turner Entertainment and Hanna-Barbera Productions (which would be sold to Turner in 1991) debuted on [[Fox Kids]] and for a couple of years, aired on British children's show, [[CBBC]]. It featured a youthful version of the famous cat-and-mouse duo chasing each other. As with the 1975 H-B series, Jerry wears his red bowtie, while Tom now wears a red cap. Spike and his son Tyke (who now had talking dialogue) and Droopy and his son Dripple, appeared in back-up segments for the show, which ran until November 18, 1994.

===Individual episodes (2001 and 2005)===
In 2001, a new television special entitled ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat]]'' premiered on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen.  In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a [[habitrail]], is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not &quot;blame everything on the mouse&quot;.

In 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, entitled ''[[The Karate Guard]]'', which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, [[storyboard]]ed by Joseph Barbera and [[Iwao Takamoto]] and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005. As part of the celebration of ''Tom and Jerry'''s sixty-fifth anniversary, this marked Barbera's first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna's original MGM cartoon shorts. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006.

===Warner Bros. era (2006–2008)===
During the first half of 2006, a new series called ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' was produced at [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Thirteen half-hour episodes (each consisting of three shorts, some of them—like ''The Karate Guard''—were produced and completed in 2003 as part of a 30-plus theatrical cartoon schedule aborted after the financial disaster of ''[[Looney Tunes Back in Action]]'') were produced, with only markets outside of the United States and United Kingdom signed up. The show then came to the UK in February 2006 on [[Boomerang (UK)|Boomerang]], and it went to the U.S. on [[The CW4Kids]] on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]].&lt;ref name=&quot;toynews&quot;&gt;[http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=194&amp;itemid=9316 Kids' WB! on The CW Announces 2006-2007 &quot;Too Big for Your TV&quot; Saturday Morning Programming Schedule - Cartoons - ToyNewsI.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tales'' is the first ''Tom and Jerry'' TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the slapstick.  The series was canceled on March 22, 2008, leading to the end of Tom and Jerry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, in January 2012, the series returned and moved to [[Cartoon Network]], but only reruns showed under the &quot;new episodes&quot; moniker.


===Cartoon Network Reboot (2013)===
Cartoon Network has announced a new show com­prised of two 11-minute shorts, with each episode fea­turing Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse plot­ting against each other. But this time, the car­toon may­hem will not be lim­ited to only Tom and Jerry’s tra­di­tional sub­ur­ban set­ting. In The Tom and Jerry Show, the title char­ac­ters’ non­stop game of cat and mouse will expand to also include more fan­tas­tic worlds, from a medieval cas­tle to a mad scientist’s lab. Pre­serv­ing the look, core char­ac­ters and sen­si­bil­ity of the orig­i­nal the­atri­cal shorts, The Tom and Jerry Show shines a brightly col­ored, high-definition lens on a never-ending bat­tle that has set the stan­dard for car­toon rival­ries.

Sam Reg­is­ter ([[The Looney Tunes Show]], [[MAD]], [[Teen Titans]]) serves as exec­u­tive pro­ducer on The Tom and Jerry Show. The series is being pro­duced by Warner Bros. Ani­ma­tion in con­junc­tion with pro­duc­ers Dar­rell Van Cit­ters and Ash­ley Postle­waite at Rene­gade Animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcdb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/tom-jerry-show-coming-cartoon-network-4850/|title=The Tom and Jerry Show Coming to Cartoon Network||publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==''Tom and Jerry'' outside the United States==
When shown on terrestrial television in the [[United Kingdom]] (from 1967 to 2000, usually on the [[BBC]]) ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were not cut for violence and Mammy was retained. As well as having regular slots (mainly after the evening BBC News with around 2 episodes shown every evening and occasionally shown on children's network [[CBBC]] in the morning), ''Tom and Jerry'' served the BBC in another way. When faced with disruption to the schedules (such as those occurring when live broadcasts overrun), the BBC would invariably turn to ''Tom and Jerry'' to fill any gaps, confident that it would retain much of an audience that might otherwise channel hop. This proved particularly helpful in 1993, when ''[[Noel's House Party]]'' had to be cancelled due to an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb scare at [[BBC Television Centre]] - ''Tom and Jerry'' was shown instead, bridging the gap until the next programme. In 2006, a mother complained to [[OFCOM]] of the smoking scenes shown in the cartoons, since Tom often attempts to impress love interests with the habit, resulting in reports that the smoking scenes in ''Tom and Jerry'' films may be subject to censorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5271470.stm | work=BBC News | title=Smoke's no joke for Tom and Jerry | date=August 21, 2006 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its lack of dialogue, ''Tom and Jerry'' was easily translated into various foreign languages. ''Tom and Jerry'' began broadcast in [[Japan]] in 1965. A 2005 nationwide survey taken in Japan by [[TV Asahi]], sampling age groups from teenagers to adults in their sixties, ranked ''Tom and Jerry'' #85 in a list of the top 100 &quot;[[anime]]&quot; of all time; while their web poll taken after the airing of the list ranked it at #58 - the only non-Japanese animation on the list, and beating anime classics like ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', ''[[A Little Princess Sara]]'', and the ultra-classics ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' (it should be noted that in Japan, the word &quot;anime&quot; refers to ''all'' animation regardless of origin, not just Japanese animation).&lt;ref name=&quot;anime&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051124035134/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/anime100/contents/ranking/cur/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/anime100/contents/ranking/cur/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;　''Tom and Jerry'' is long-time licensed mascots for [[Nagoya]]-based Juuroku Bank.

''Tom and Jerry'' have long been popular in [[Germany]]. However, the cartoons are overdubbed with rhyming [[German language]] verse that describes what is happening onscreen, sometimes adding or revising information. The different episodes are usually embedded in the episode ''[[Jerry's Diary]]'' (1949), in which Tom reads about past adventures.

In [[India]], [[South East Asia]], [[Armenia]], [[the Middle East]], [[Egypt]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], other [[Latin American]] countries, and in eastern European countries (such as [[Romania]]), Cartoon Network still airs ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons every day. In [[Russia]], local channels also air the show in their daytime programming slot. ''Tom and Jerry'' was one of the few cartoons of western origin broadcast in Czechoslovakia (1988) and Romania (until 1989) before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989.

In [[Indonesia]], Tom &amp; Jerry began broadcasting on [[MNCTV]] in mid 90s, later rerun on [[RCTI]] on 2006/2007. In 2011/2012, moving to [[Antv|ANTV]] as part of ''Anak Keren'' block. When shown on MNCTV and RCTI, just showing Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons only. But on ANTV, showing Tom &amp; Jerry cartoons and another MGM cartoons, like [[Droopy]] and [[Barney Bear]] who had never aired in Indonesia prior to 2011/2012.

Even though Gene Deitch's episodes were created in Czechoslovakia (1960 - 1962), the first official TV release of ''Tom and Jerry'' was in 1988.

==Feature films==
{{start date|1992|10|01}} saw the first international release of ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'' when the film was released overseas to theatres in [[Europe]] of that year and then domestically by [[Miramax Films]] in {{start date|1993|07|30}}, with future video and DVD releases that would be sold under Warner Brothers. Barbera served as creative consultant for the picture, which was produced and directed by [[Phil Roman]]. A musical film with a structure similar to MGM's blockbusters, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', the movie was criticized by critics for giving the pair dialogue (and songs) through the entire movie. It was also criticized because the film did not completely focus on the duo. Although it fared slightly better with audiences, it did not garner much at the box office, thus making it a [[box office bomb]]. In 2001, Warner Bros. (which had, by then, merged with Turner and assumed its properties) released the duo's first direct-to-video movie, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring]]'', in which Tom covets a ring which grants mystical powers to the wearer, and has become accidentally stuck on Jerry's head. It would mark the last time Hanna and Barbera co-produced a ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon together, as William Hanna died shortly after ''The Magic Ring'' was released.

Four years later, [[Bill Kopp]] scripted and directed two more ''Tom and Jerry'' DTV features for the studio, ''[[Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry]]'', the latter one based on a story by Barbera. Both were released on DVD in 2005, marking the celebration of Tom and Jerry's 65th anniversary. In 2006, another direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers]]'', tells the story about the pair having to work together to find the treasure. Joe came up with the storyline for the next film, ''[[Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale]]'', as well as the initial idea of synchronizing the on-screen actions to music from Tchaikovsky's ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]''. This DTV film, directed by [[Spike Brandt]] and [[Tony Cervone]], would be Joe Barbera's last ''Tom and Jerry'' project due to his passing in December 2006. The holiday-set animated film was released on DVD in late 2007, and dedicated to Barbera. A new direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes]]'', was released on August 24, 2010. It is the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie produced without any of the characters' original creators. The next direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz]]'', was released on August 23, 2011 and was the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie made for [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].  It had a preview showing on Cartoon Network. Their latest made-for-video caper, ''Robin Hood and his Merry Mouse'' has been released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012.&lt;ref name=MerryMouse /&gt;

[[Warner Bros.]] has plans for a theatrically released film starring Tom and Jerry. The film will be, according to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', &quot;an origin story that reveals how Tom and Jerry first meet and form their rivalry before getting lost in Chicago and reluctantly working together during an arduous journey home&quot;. So far [[Dan Lin]] will be producing the film, while screenwriter [[Eric Gravning]] is also hired on the project.  Warner Bros., in their Variety review, replied they are using Tom and Jerry to create their own &quot;''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'' family franchise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998898.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 | work=Variety | title=Tom and Jerry head to the bigscreen | first=Marc | last=Graser | date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://my.spill.com/forum/topics/tom-and-jerry-live-action-film&lt;/ref&gt;However there been not much info right now.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998898.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562 | work=Variety | title=Tom and Jerry head to the bigscreen | first=Marc | last=Graser | date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://my.spill.com/forum/topics/tom-and-jerry-live-action-film&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Image:TruceBlackface.jpg|thumb|200px|left| Screen capture from the episode ''[[The Truce Hurts]]''. The characters in this shot have turned into black stereotypes after a passing car splashed mud on their faces. Scenes such as this are frequently cut from modern broadcasts of ''Tom and Jerry'']]

Like a number of other animated cartoons from the 1930s to the early 1950s, ''Tom and Jerry'' featured racial stereotypes. After explosions, for example, characters with blasted faces would resemble stereotypical blacks, with large lips and bow-tied hair. Perhaps the most controversial element of the show is the character Mammy Two Shoes, a poor black maid who speaks in a stereotypical &quot;black accent&quot; and has a rodent problem. Joseph Barbera, who was responsible for these gags, claimed that the racial gags in ''Tom and Jerry'' did not reflect his racial opinion; they were just reflecting what was common in society and cartoons at the time and were meant to be humorous.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeonardMaltin&quot; /&gt; Nevertheless, such stereotypes are considered by some to be racist today, and most of the blackface gags are cut when these shorts are aired, even though [[Mouse in Manhattan]] was shown uncut in July 25th, 2012 on [[Cartoon Network]]. Mammy Two-Shoes' voice was redubbed by Turner in the mid-1990s to make the character sound less stereotypical; the resulting accent sounds more Irish. One cartoon in particular, ''[[His Mouse Friday]]'', is usually kept out of television rotation because of its depiction of cannibals. If shown, the cannibals' dialogue is edited out, although their mouths still move.

In Tom and Jerry's ''Spotlight Collection'' DVD, a disclaimer by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] warns viewers about the potentially offensive material in the cartoons and emphasizes that they were &quot;wrong then and they are wrong today&quot;, borrowing a phrase from the Warner Bros. Golden collection. This disclaimer is also used in the ''Tom and Jerry Golden Collection: Volume 1''.

{{quotation|The cartoons you are about to see are products of their time. They may depict some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that were commonplace in the U.S society. These depictions were wrong then and they are wrong today.  While the following does not represent the Warner Bros. view of today's society, these cartoons are being presented as they were originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming that these prejudices never existed.}}


In 2006, United Kingdom channel [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] made plans to edit ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons being aired in the UK where the characters were seen to be smoking in a manner that was &quot;condoned, acceptable or glamorized.&quot; This followed a complaint from a viewer who thought smoking was wrong and that, thus,  that the cartoons were not appropriate for younger viewers, There was a subsequent investigation by UK media watchdog [[OFCOM]].&lt;ref name =&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt; It has also taken the U.S. approach by editing out blackface gags, though this seems to be random as not all scenes of this type are cut.

==Other formats==
''Tom and Jerry'' began appearing in [[comic book]]s in 1942, as one of the features in ''Our Gang Comics''. In 1949, with MGM's live-action ''[[Our Gang]]'' shorts having ceased production five years earlier, the series was renamed ''Tom and Jerry Comics''. The pair continued to appear in various books for the rest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;comics&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060825004657/http://funnies.goldenagecartoons.com/doubletrouble/ Tom and Jerry Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair have also appeared in a number of [[video game]]s as well, spanning titles for systems from the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Nintendo 64]] to more recent entries for [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]], and [[Nintendo GameCube]].

Throughout the years, the term and title ''Tom and Jerry'' became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related &quot;cat and mouse fight&quot; metaphor has. Yet in ''Tom and Jerry'' it wasn't the more powerful (Tom) that usually came out on top.

Author [[Steven Millhauser]] wrote a short story called ''Cat 'n' Mouse'' which pits the duo against one another as antagonist and protagonist in literary form. Millhauser allows his reader access to the thoughts and emotions of the two characters in a way that wasn't done in the cartoon.

In January 2009, IGN named Tom and Jerry as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.&lt;ref&gt;http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/66.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
''[[The Simpsons]]'' characters, ''[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy]]'', the featured cartoon on the ''[[Krusty the Clown]]'' Show, are spoofs of ''Tom and Jerry'' &amp;ndash; a &quot;cartoon within a cartoon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyTeleL&quot;/&gt; The cartoon violence of ''Tom and Jerry'' is parodied and intensified, as Itchy (the mouse) dispatches Scratchy in a variety of gratuitous, gory methods.

In another episode, &quot;[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]&quot;, the short cartoon &quot;Worker and Parasite&quot;, is a reference to the [[History of Russian animation|Eastern European]] ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons directed by Gene Deitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groening&quot;&gt;Groening, Matt. (2004). DVD Commentary for &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the animation, director [[David Silverman]] [[photocopy|photocopied]] several drawings and made the animation very jerky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman&quot;&gt;Silverman, David. (2004). DVD Commentary for &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anchors-aweigh.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Jerry and Gene Kelly in the 1945 musical film ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''.]]
In 1945, Jerry made an appearance in the live-action MGM musical feature film ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'', in which, through the use of special effects, he performs a dance routine with [[Gene Kelly]]. In this sequence, Gene Kelly is telling a class of school kids a fictional tale of how he earned his [[Medal of Honor]]: Jerry is the king of a magical world populated with cartoon animals, which he has forbidden to dance as he himself does not know how. Gene Kelly's character then comes along and guides Jerry through an elaborate dance routine, resulting in Jerry awarding him with a medal. Originally the writers wanted [[Mickey Mouse]] but [[Roy O. Disney]] ([[Walt Disney]]'s brother and financial adviser) refused to give the rights to the character, so Jerry Mouse was used instead. Jerry speaks and sings in this short film; his voice is performed by [[Sara Berner]]. Tom has a cameo in the sequence as one of Jerry's servants. This sequence was later lifted and reanimated frame-for-frame in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode &quot;[[Road to Rupert]]&quot;, where Jerry was replaced with [[Stewie Griffin]].

[[Image:Dangerous When Wet.JPG|left|200px|thumb|''Tom and Jerry'' and Esther Williams in the 1953 musical film ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]''.]]
Both Tom and Jerry appear with [[Esther Williams]] in a dream sequence in another big-screen musical, ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]''. In the film, Tom and Jerry are chasing each other underwater, when they run into Esther Williams, with whom they perform an extended synchronized swimming routine. Tom and Jerry have to save Williams from a lecherous octopus, who tries to lure and woo her into his (many) arms.

In 1988, the duo were lined up to appear in the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]] film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', a homage to classic American animation. However when the executive producer [[Steven Spielberg]] went to acquire the rights in 1986, MGM's pre-1986 library (which Tom and Jerry were a part of) was being purchased by [[Turner Entertainment]] which created a series of legal complications.  Due to this Spielberg was unable to acquire the rights and Tom and Jerry's inclusion in the film was scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Jeffrey and Seaman, Peter S. (September 6, 1986). ''Who Shot Roger Rabbit?'' [Screenplay]. The third draft of the ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' script calls for Tom and Jerry to attend &quot;Toontown&quot; owner Marvin Acme's funeral, a sequence ultimately not shot for the film.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview found on the DVD releases, several ''[[MADtv]]'' cast members stated that Tom and Jerry is one of their biggest influences for slapstick comedy. [[Johnny Knoxville]] from ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' has stated that watching ''Tom and Jerry'' inspired many of the stunts in the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n10/htdocs/behind-the-scenes-with-johnny-knoxville-554.php | title=Behind the Scenes with Johnny Knoxville | work=Vice Magazine | accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, Tom and Jerry were featured in a [[Ford Mondeo]] advert celebrating 100 years of Ford, starting off as a cartoon, then coming to life.

''Tom and Jerry'' was parodied as &quot;Ted and Jimmy&quot; in the ''[[Fairly Oddparents]]'' television movie ''[[Channel Chasers]]''.

During a [[Johnny Test]] episode, the title was called &quot;Tom and Johnny&quot;.

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
MGM/UA released a series of ''Tom &amp; Jerry'' laserdisc box sets in the 1990s. ''The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry'' volumes 1 and 2, contain all the MGM shorts up to (but not including) the Deitch Era,  including letterboxed versions of the shorts filmed in CinemaScope.  The cartoons are all intact save for ''[[His Mouse Friday]]'' (dialogue has been wiped) and ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]'' which is the re-drawn version with June Foray's voice added. A third volume to ''The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry'' was released and contains all of the Chuck Jones-era ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts.

There have been several ''Tom and Jerry'' DVDs released in [[DVD region code|Region]] 1  (the United States and Canada), including a series of two-disc sets known as the ''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection]]''. There have been negative responses to Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, due to some of the cartoons included on each having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two-Shoes dialogue. A replacement program offering uncut versions of the shorts on DVD was later announced. There are also negative responses to Vol. 3, due to ''[[Mouse Cleaning]]'' and ''[[Casanova Cat]]'' being excluded from these sets and ''His Mouse Friday'' being edited for content with an extreme zooming-in towards the end to avoid showing a particularly race-based caricature.

There have been two ''Tom and Jerry'' DVD sets in [[DVD region code|Region]] 2. In Western Europe, most of the ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts have been released (only two, ''[[The Million Dollar Cat]]'' and ''[[Busy Buddies]]'', were not included) under the name ''Tom and Jerry&amp;nbsp;— The Classic Collection''. Almost all of the shorts contain re-dubbed Mammy Two-Shoes tracks. Despite these cuts, ''His Mouse Friday'', the only ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon to be completely taken off the airwaves in some countries due to claims of racism, is included, unedited with the exception of zooming-in as on the North American set. These are regular TV prints sent from the U.S. in the 1990s. Shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in [[pan and scan]]. ''[[Mouse Cleaning]]'' and ''[[Casanova Cat]]'' are presented uncut as part of these sets.

''Tom and Jerry&amp;nbsp;— The Classic Collection'' is available in 6 double-sided DVDs (issued in the United Kingdom) and 12 single-layer DVDs (issued throughout Western Europe, including the United Kingdom). Another ''Tom and Jerry'' [[DVD region code|Region]] 2 DVD set is available in Japan. As with ''Tom and Jerry&amp;nbsp;— The Classic Collection'' in Western Europe, almost all of the shorts (including ''His Mouse Friday'') contain cuts. ''[[Slicked-up Pup]]'', ''[[Tom's Photo Finish]]'', ''[[Busy Buddies]]'', ''[[The Egg and Jerry]]'', ''[[Tops with Pops]]'' and ''[[Feedin' the Kiddie]]'' are excluded from these sets. However, these cartoons are included in the UK version. Shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in [[pan and scan]] for showing on the 4:3 [[aspect ratio]] television screen.

The Chuck Jones-era ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts were released in a two-disc set entitled ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection]]'' on June 23, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVShowsOnDVD&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tom-Jerry-Chuck-Jones-Collection/11388 ''Tom and Jerry: New 2-DVD set collects the Chuck Jones Shorts into One Package]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25, 2011, Warner Home Video released the first volume of the ''[[Tom and Jerry Golden Collection]]'' on DVD and Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Tom-Jerry-Golden-Collection-Volume-1/15578&lt;/ref&gt; This set featured newly remastered prints and bonus material yet seen before. The sets were aimed at the collector in a way that the previous &quot;''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection|Spotlight]]''&quot; DVD releases were not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Bugs-Bunny-Looney-Tunes-Comedy-Hour-Stu's-Show-Jerry-Beck/14771&lt;/ref&gt; A second set is due for release in 2013.

The domestic '''dog''' (''Canis lupus familiaris''),&lt;ref name = &quot;MSW3 Lupus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14000738 |title=Mammal Species of the World – Browse: lupus |publisher=Bucknell.edu |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; is a [[gray wolf subspecies|subspecies of]] the [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), a member of the [[Canidae]] family of the [[mammal]]ian order [[Carnivora]]. The term &quot;domestic dog&quot; is generally used for both [[domesticated]] and [[feral]] varieties. The dog may have been the first animal to be domesticated, and has been the most widely kept [[working dog|working]], [[hunting]], and [[pet]] in human history. The word &quot;dog&quot; may also mean the male of a canine species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dog |title=Dog |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the word &quot;bitch&quot; for the female of the species.

The present lineage of dogs [[origin of the domestic dog|was domesticated from gray wolves]] about 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;science2002&quot;/&gt; Though remains of domesticated dogs have been found in Siberia and Belgium from about 33,000 years ago, none of those lineages seem to have survived the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. Although mDNA testing suggests an evolutionary split between dogs and wolves around 100,000 years ago, no specimens prior to 33,000 years ago are clearly morphologically domesticated dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fossil dogs and wolves from Palaeolithic sites in Belgium, the Ukraine and Russia: osteometry, ancient DNA and stable isotopes|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2008.09.033|year=2009|last1=Germonpré|first1=Mietje|last2=Sablin|first2=Mikhail V.|last3=Stevens|first3=Rhiannon E.|last4=Hedges|first4=Robert E.M.|last5=Hofreiter|first5=Michael|last6=Stiller|first6=Mathias|last7=Després|first7=Viviane R.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=36|issue=2|pages=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IncipientDog&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.02.028|author=Pionnier-Capitan M, Bemilli C, Bodu P, Célérier G, Ferrié J-G, Fosse P, Garcià M, and Vigne J-D|title=New evidence for Upper Palaeolithic small domestic dogs in South-Western Europe|year=2011|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=9|pages=2123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]], and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]].

Most breeds of dogs are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[dog behavior|behaviors]] by people for specific functional roles.

==Etymology and related terminology==
&quot;Dog&quot; is the common use term that refers to members of the subspecies ''Canis lupus familiaris'' (''canis'', &quot;dog&quot;; ''lupus'', &quot;wolf&quot;; ''familiaris'', &quot;of a household&quot; or &quot;domestic&quot;).  The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus ''Canis'', or &quot;true dogs&quot;, including the [[wolf]], [[coyote]], and [[jackal]]s, or it can refer to the members of the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Canidae#Species and taxonomy|Canini]], which would also include the [[African wild dog]], or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the [[fox]]es, [[bush dog]], [[raccoon dog]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rasmussen |first=G.

In 14th-century England, &quot;[[hound]]&quot; (from {{lang-ang|hund}}) was the general word for all domestic canines, and &quot;dog&quot; referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff.

In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English ''bicche'', from Old English ''bicce'', ultimately from Old Norse ''bikkja''). A group of offspring is a [[litter (animal)|litter]]. The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam. Offspring are, in general, called pups or [[puppy|puppies]], from French ''poupée'', until they are about a year old. The process of birth is whelping, from the Old English word ''hwelp'' (cf. German ''Welpe'', Dutch ''welp'', Swedish ''valpa'', Icelandic ''hvelpur'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gould, Jean |title=All about dog breeding for quality and soundness |publisher=Pelham |location=London, Eng |year=1978 |isbn=0-7207-1064-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
In 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, [[Carl Linnaeus]], listed among the types of [[quadruped]]s familiar to him, the Latin word for dog, ''canis''. Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the [[fox]], as ''Canis vulpes'', [[wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), and the domestic dog, (''Canis canis''; see [[:File:Linnaeus - Regnum Animale (1735).png]]).

In later editions, Linnaeus dropped ''Canis canis'' and greatly expanded his list of the ''Canis'' genus of quadrupeds, and by 1758 included alongside the foxes, wolves, and [[Canis aureus|jackals]] and many more terms that are now listed as synonyms for domestic dog, including ''aegyptius'' (hairless dog), ''aquaticus'', ([[water dog]]), and ''mustelinus'' (literally “[[badger dog]])”.  Among these were two that later experts have been widely used for domestic dogs as a species: ''Canis domesticus'' and, most predominantly, ''Canis familiaris'', the “common” or “familiar” dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Linnaeus| first = Carolus| authorlink = Carolus Linnaeus| title = Systema naturae per regna tria naturae:secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.| publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii)| year = 1758| page = 38| url = http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726931| accessdate =8 September 2008| volume = 1| edition = 10th}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The domestic dog was accepted as a species in its own right until overwhelming evidence from behavior, vocalizations, morphology, and [[molecular biology]] led to the contemporary scientific understanding that a single species, the gray wolf, is the [[common descent|common ancestor]] for all breeds of domestic dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;serpell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Serpell, James |title=The domestic dog: its evolution, behaviour, and interactions with people |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-42537-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=727488 |title=ITIS Standard Report Page: Canis familiarus domesticus |publisher=Itis.gov |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of this fact, the domestic dog was reclassified in 1993 as ''Canis lupus familiaris'', a subspecies of the gray wolf ''Canis lupus'', by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[American Society of Mammalogists]]. ''C. l. familiaris'' is listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in the scientific community and recommended by [[ITIS]], although ''Canis familiaris'' is a recognised synonym.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = ITIS Report: Canis lupus familiaris|work=ITIS Data|publisher=Integrated Taxonomic Information System |url = http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=726821|accessdate =16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, ''C. domesticus'' and all taxa referring to domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] in 1792, and [[Christen Smith|Christian Smith]] in 1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed as [[taxonomic synonym]]s for ''Canis lupus familiaris'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bucknell.edu/MSW3/browse.asp?id=14000752 |title=Mammal Species of the World – Browse: familiaris |publisher=Bucknell.edu |accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[pack hunter]]s with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;

Although experts largely disagree over the details of [[dog domestication]], it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.&lt;ref name=MiklosiDomestication&gt;Miklósi, pp. 95–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas particularly Siberia and Europe.  Currently it is thought domestication of our current lineage of dog occurred sometime as early as 15,000 years ago and arguably as late as 8500 years ago.  Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world. 

Emigrants from [[Siberia]] likely crossed the [[Bering Strait]] with dogs in their company, and some experts{{Who|date=February 2011}} suggest the use of [[sled dogs]] may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Miklósi, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were an important part of life for the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabascan]] population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the [[Apache]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as [[pack animal]]s in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the [[horse]] to North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dogs history of America|author=Derr, Mark |year=2004|publisher=North Point Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate,&lt;ref name=MiklosiDomestication /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; although more recent evidence shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/01/24/dog-mans-best-friend-for-over-33000-years Dog: man's best friend for over 33,000 years].

It is not known whether humans domesticated the wolf as such to initiate dog's divergence from its ancestors, or whether dog's evolutionary path had already taken a different course prior to domestication. For example, it is  hypothesized that some wolves gathered around the campsites of paleolithic camps to scavenge refuse, and associated evolutionary pressure developed that favored those who were less frightened by, and keener in approaching, humans.

[[File:Tesem2.jpg|thumb|[[Tesem]], an old Egyptian sighthound-like dog.]]
The bulk of the scientific evidence for the evolution of the domestic dog stems from morphological studies of archaeological findings and [[mitochondrial DNA]] studies. The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late [[Upper Paleolithic]] close to the [[Pleistocene]]/[[Holocene]] boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2498669.stm| title = Origin of dogs traced| accessdate =29 November 2006| last = McGourty| first = Christine| date = 22 November 2002| publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there is a wide range of other, contradictory findings that make this issue controversial.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  There are findings beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding of teeth.

Archaeological evidence suggests the latest dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt; In 2008, a team of international scientists released findings from an excavation at Goyet Cave in Belgium declaring a large, toothy canine existed 31,700 years ago and ate a diet of horse, [[musk ox]] and reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370 World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big]&quot; ''msnbc'' 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA studies===
DNA studies have provided a wide range of possible divergence dates, from 15,000 to 40,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;science2002&quot;/&gt; to as much as 100,000 to 140,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Vilà C |title=Multiple and ancient origins of the domestic dog |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5319 |pages=1687–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9180076 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5319.1687|author2=Savolainen P|author3=Maldonado JE|last4=Amorim|first4=IR|last5=Rice|first5=JE|last6=Honeycutt|first6=RL|last7=Crandall|first7=KA|last8=Lundeberg|first8=J|last9=Wayne|first9=RK}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results depend on a number of assumptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt; Genetic studies are based on comparisons of [[genetic diversity]] between species, and depend on a calibration date. Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf-coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.&lt;ref&gt;Miklósi, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; If this estimate is incorrect, and the actual wolf-coyote divergence is closer to one or two million years ago, or more,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=44854&amp;is_real_user=1 |title=Paleodb.org |publisher=Paleodb.org |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the DNA evidence that supports specific dog-wolf divergence dates would be interpreted very differently.

Furthermore, it is believed the genetic diversity of wolves has been in decline for the last 200 years, and that the genetic diversity of dogs has been reduced by [[selective breeding]]. This could significantly bias DNA analyses to support an earlier divergence date. The genetic evidence for the domestication event occurring in East Asia is also subject to violations of assumptions. These conclusions are based on the location of maximal [[genetic divergence]], and assume hybridization does not occur, and that breeds remain geographically localized. Although these assumptions hold for many species, there is good reason to believe that they do not hold for canines.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;

Genetic analyses indicate all dogs are likely descended from a handful of domestication events with a small number of founding females,&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; although there is evidence domesticated dogs [[introgression|interbred with local populations]] of wild wolves on several occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;science2002&quot;/&gt; Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;science2002&quot;/&gt; The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest [[genetic variability]] and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the [[Basenji]], [[Lhasa Apso]], and [[Siberian Husky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;parker&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Parker HG |title=Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog |journal=Science |volume=304 |issue=5674 |pages=1160–4 |year=2004 |pmid=15155949 |doi=10.1126/science.1097406|bibcode = 2004Sci...304.1160P|author2=Kim LV|author3=Sutter NB|last4=Carlson|first4=S|last5=Lorentzen|first5=TD|last6=Malek|first6=TB|last7=Johnson|first7=GS|last8=Defrance|first8=HB|last9=Ostrander|first9=EA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some breeds thought to be very old, such as the [[Pharaoh Hound]], [[Ibizan Hound]], and [[Norwegian Elkhound]], are now known to have been created more recently.&lt;ref name=&quot;parker&quot;/&gt;

A great deal of controversy surrounds the evolutionary framework for the domestication of dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;&gt;Miklósi&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is widely claimed that &quot;man domesticated the wolf,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;koler2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Anthrozoos|title=The Origin of the Dog Revisited|author=Koler-Matznick, Janice |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; man may not have taken such a proactive role in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt; The nature of the interaction between man and wolf that led to domestication is unknown and controversial. At least three early species of the ''Homo'' genus began spreading out of Africa roughly 400,000 years ago, and thus lived for a considerable time in contact with canine species.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;

Despite this, there is no evidence of any adaptation of canine species to the presence of the close relatives of modern man. If dogs were domesticated, as believed, roughly 15,000 years ago, the event (or events) would have coincided with a large expansion in human territory and the development of agriculture. This has led some biologists to suggest one of the forces that led to the domestication of dogs was a shift in human lifestyle in the form of established human settlements. Permanent settlements would have coincided with a greater amount of disposable food and would have created a barrier between wild and anthropogenic canine populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;miklosi&quot;/&gt;

Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groves&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Groves| first  = Colin| year  = 1999|title  = The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being Domesticated | journal=Perspectives in Human Biology|volume = 4| pages = 1–12 | issn  = 1038-5762}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They would have benefited from humans’ upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.&lt;ref name = Groves/&gt; Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.&lt;ref name = Groves/&gt;

Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Tacon |first2=Colin |last2=Pardoe |year=2002 |title=Dogs make us human |journal=Nature Australia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt; Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression “three dog night” (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt; 

Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' sensitive sense of smell to assist with the hunt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt; The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruusila&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Vesa |last1=Ruusila |first2=Mauri |last2=Pesonen|year=2004 |title=Interspecific cooperation in human (''Homo sapiens'') hunting: the benefits of a barking dog (''Canis familiaris'') |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=545–9 |url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf41/anzf41-545.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newby&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Newby  |first = Jonica  |title = The Pact for Survival  |publisher=ABC Books |location = Sydney |year = 1997  |isbn = 0-7333-0581-4}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Family pet.jpg|thumb|alt=Couple sitting on the lawn with a pet British Bulldog| A [[Bulldog|British Bulldog]] shares a day at the park.]]

[[File:Dog in Clark.jpg|thumb|right|Toy dog]]
&quot;The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tacon&quot;/&gt; and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derr&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Derr  |first = Mark  |title = Dog’s Best Friend  |publisher=University of Chicago Press  |location = Chicago  |year = 1997  |isbn = 0-226-14280-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Derr&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today &lt;ref name=&quot;Franklin&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14036090600813760|last = Franklin| first = A| year = 2006| title = Be[a]ware of the Dog: a post-humanist approach to housing| journal=Housing Theory and Society| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 137–156| issn = 1403-6096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (using the expression “in the doghouse” to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children’s playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Katz  |first = Jon  |title = The New Work of Dogs  |publisher=Villard Books  |location = New York  |year = 2003  |isbn = 0-375-76055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other’s lives,&lt;ref name=&quot;Haraway&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Haraway |first = Donna  |title = The Companion Species manifesto : Dogs, People and Significant Otherness  |publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press  |location = Chicago |year = 2003  |isbn = 0-9717575-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Power| first  = Emma| year  = 2008| title  = Furry Families: Making a Human-Dog Family through Home| journal=Social and Cultural Geography| volume = 9| issue = 5| pages = 535–555| doi  = 10.1080/14649360802217790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the ‘commodification’ of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt; The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt;

The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their dog as part of the family,&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot; /&gt; although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt; A [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] model of dog-human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program ''[[Dog Whisperer]]''. However it has been disputed that &quot;trying to achieve status&quot; is characteristic of dog–human interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bradshaw  |first = John |last2 = Blackwell |first2 = Emily J.|last3 = Casey|first3 = Rachel A.| title = Dominance in domestic dogs: useful construct or bad habit?| journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior  |volume = 4  |year = 2009| pages = 135–144 |publisher=Elsevier| url = http://www.pawsoflife.org/pdf/Library%20articles/Bradshaw%202009.pdf| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sIbRXtwx| archivedate = 27 August 2010| doi = 10.1016/j.jveb.2008.08.004| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tannen&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1207/s15327973rlsi3704_1|last = Tannen| first = Deborah|year = 2004| title = Talking the Dog: Framing Pets as Interactional Resources in Family Discourse| journal=Research on Language and Social Interaction| volume = 37| issue = 4 | pages = 399–420| issn  = 1532-7973}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another study of dogs’ roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members, the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher, and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Power&quot;/&gt; Increasingly, human family members are engaging in activities  centred on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as [[Musical canine freestyle|Dog Dancing]] and [[Doga (Dog Yoga)|Doga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nast&quot;/&gt;

According to the statistics published by the [[American Pet Products Manufacturers Association]] in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5&amp;nbsp;million dog owners in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html| title=U.S. Pet Ownership Statistics|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any [[gender preference]] among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are undergoing to promote [[pet adoption]], less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.

=== Work ===
Dogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname, &quot;man's best friend&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.almostheaven-golden-retriever-rescue.org/old-drum.html| title = The Story of Old Drum| accessdate =29 November 2006| publisher=Cedarcroft Farm Bed &amp; Breakfast&amp;nbsp;— Warrensburg, MO}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase used in other languages as well.

Dogs included in human activities in terms of helping out humans are usually called [[working dogs]]. Dogs of several breeds are considered working dogs. Some working dog breeds include [[American Akita|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[Anatolian Shepherd Dog]], [[Bernese Mountain Dog]], [[Black Russian Terrier]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Bullmastiff]], [[Doberman Pinscher]], [[Dogue de Bordeaux]], [[German Pinscher]], [[German Shepherd]],&lt;ref name=&quot;akc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepherd_dog/|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=German Shepherd Dog &amp;#124; American Kennel Club|publisher=American Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giant Schnauzer]], [[Great Dane]], [[Great Pyrenees]], [[Great Swiss Mountain Dog]], [[Komondor]], [[Kuvasz]], [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]], [[Neapolitan Mastiff]], [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], [[Portuguese Water Dog]], [[Rottweiler]], [[St. Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Siberian Husky]], [[Standard Schnauzer]], and [[Tibetan Mastiff]].

=== Sports and shows ===
{{See also|Conformation show}}
Owners of dogs often enter them in competitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as breed conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

Dog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China, and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eat not this flesh: food avoidances from prehistory to the present|author=Simoons, Frederick J. |edition=second|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-299-14254-4|pages=208–212|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JwGZTQunH00C&amp;pg=PA208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 13–16&amp;nbsp;million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/03/9/dogs.catseatenAsia903.html How many dogs and cats are eaten in Asia?].

The most popular Korean dog dish is ''[[bosintang|gaejang-guk]]'' (also called ''bosintang''), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's ''[[Qi|gi]]'', or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with [[scallion]]s and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.&lt;ref&gt;Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 84–85  ISBN 1-86189-348-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultures, such as [[Polynesia]] and [[pre-Columbian Mexico]], also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as [[taboo food and drink|taboo]]. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day |first=Matthew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/5985367/Polish-couple-accused-of-making-dog-meat-delicacy.html |title=Polish couple accused of making dog meat delicacy|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=7 August 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CNN report in China dated March 2010 interviews a dog meat vendor who states that most of the dogs that are available for selling to [[restaurant]] are raised in special farms but that there is always a chance that a sold dog is someone's lost pet, although dog pet breeds are not considered edible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/03/09/china.animals/index.html| title=Inside the cat and dog meat market in China|date=9 March 2010|accessdate=24 June 2010 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs, not just from dog ownership. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1097/00005053-199108000-00006 |author=Wilson CC |title=The pet as an anxiolytic intervention |journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease |volume=179 |issue=8 |pages=482–9 |year=1991 |pmid=1856711}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the [[hygiene hypothesis]], can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases.

==Biology==
{{Main|Dog anatomy}}

[[File:Dog anatomy lateral skeleton view.jpg|thumb|250px|Lateral view of a dog's bone structure.]]
Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Nevertheless, their morphology is based on that of their wild ancestors, gray wolves.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;
Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}. The largest known dog was an [[English Mastiff]] which weighed {{convert|155.6|kg}} and was {{convert|250|cm|abbr=on}} from the snout to the tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;zorba&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldslargestdog1.com/zorba2/|title=World's Largest Dog|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest dog is a [[Great Dane]] that stands {{convert|106.7|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110711133443/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |title=Guinness World Records – Tallest Dog Living |accessdate=7 January 2009 |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=31 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senses===

====Vision====
[[File:Auge Hund Diagramm engl.jpg|thumb|300px|Dog's visual [[colour perception]] compared with humans.]]
Like most mammals, dogs are [[dichromacy|dichromats]] and have color vision equivalent to red-green [[color blindness]] in humans (deuteranopia).&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;note1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = A&amp;E Television Networks|title = Big Dogs, Little Dogs: The companion volume to the A&amp;E special presentation|publisher=GT Publishing|series = A Lookout Book|year = 1998|isbn = 1-57719-353-9}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;note2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Dog|author=Alderton, David|year = 1984|publisher=Chartwell Books|isbn = 0-89009-786-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| coauthors = Jennifer Davis|title = Dr. P's Dog Training: Vision in Dogs &amp; People|year = 1998|url = http://www.uwsp.edu/psych/dog/LA/davis2.htm|accessdate =6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are less sensitive to differences in grey shades than humans and also can detect brightness at about half the accuracy of humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miklósi 2009, p. 140&quot;&gt;Miklósi, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dog's visual system has evolved to aid proficient hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = How Dogs Think|author=Coren, Stanley|publisher=First Free Press, Simon &amp; Schuster |year = 2004|isbn = 0-7432-2232-6}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a dog's [[visual acuity]] is poor (that of a [[poodle]]'s has been estimated to translate to a [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] rating of 20/75&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;), their visual discrimination for moving objects is very high; dogs have been shown to be able to discriminate between humans (e.g., identifying their owner) at a range of between 800 and 900 m, however this range decreases to 500–600 m if the object is stationary.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; 

Dogs have a [[temporal resolution]] of between 60 and 70&amp;nbsp;Hz, which explains why many dogs struggle to watch television, as most such modern screens are optimized for humans at 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miklósi 2009, p. 140&quot;/&gt; Dogs can detect a change in movement that exists in a single [[Dioptre|diopter]] of space within their eye. Humans, by comparison, require a change of between 10 and 20 diopters to detect movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mech, David 2006, p. 98&quot;&gt;Mech, David.

[[File:Anatomy and physiology of animals The ear.jpg|thumb|250px|The physiology of a dog ear.]]
As [[crepuscular]] hunters, dogs often rely on their vision in low light situations: They have very large pupils, a high density of [[rod cell|rods]] in the [[fovea]], an increased flicker rate, and a [[tapetum lucidum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; The tapetum is a reflective surface behind the retina that reflects light to give the photoreceptors a second chance to catch the photons. There is also a relationship between body size and overall diameter of the eye. A range of 9.5 and 11.6&amp;nbsp;mm can be found between various breeds of dogs. This 20% variance can be substantial and is associated as an adaptation toward superior night vision.&lt;ref&gt;Miklósi, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eyes of different breeds of dogs have different shapes, dimensions, and retina configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| coauthors = Jonica Newby, Caroline Penry-Davey|title = Catalyst: Dogs' Eyes|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date = 25 September 2003|url = http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s953902.htm|accessdate =26 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many long-nosed breeds have a &quot;visual streak&quot; – a wide foveal region that runs across the width of the retina and gives them a very wide field of excellent vision. Some [[cephalic index#Dolichocephalic animals|long-muzzled]] breeds, in particular, the [[sighthound]]s, have a field of vision up to 270° (compared to 180° for humans). Short-nosed breeds, on the other hand, have an &quot;area centralis&quot;: a central patch with up to three times the density of nerve endings as the visual streak, giving them detailed sight much more like a human's. Some [[Cephalic index#Brachycephalic animals|broad-headed]] breeds with short noses have a field of vision similar to that of humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;note1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;note2&quot; /&gt; 

Most breeds have [[emmetropic|good vision]], but some show a [[genetic predisposition]] for [[myopia]] – such as [[Rottweiler]]s, with which one out of every two has been found to be myopic.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Dogs also have a greater divergence of the eye axis than humans, enabling them to rotate their pupils farther in any direction. The divergence of the eye axis of dogs ranges from 12–25° depending on the breed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mech, David 2006, p. 98&quot;/&gt;

Experimentation has proven that dogs can distinguish between complex visual images such as that of a cube or a prism. Dogs also show attraction to static visual images such as the silhouette of a dog on a screen, their own reflections, or videos of dogs; however, their interest declines sharply once they are unable to make social contact with the image.&lt;ref&gt;Miklósi, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hearing====
The frequency range of dog hearing is approximately 40&amp;nbsp;Hz to 60,000&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics Factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/TimCondon.shtml|title=Frequency Range of Dog Hearing|last=Elert|first=Glenn|coauthors=Timothy Condon|year=2003|publisher=The Physics Factbook|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that dogs can detect sounds far beyond the upper limit of the human auditory spectrum.&lt;ref name=&quot;note2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Physics Factbook&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/HearingRange.html|accessdate=7 January 2008|title=How well do dogs and other animals hear}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, dogs have ear mobility, which allows them to rapidly pinpoint the exact location of a sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dog Sense of Hearing&quot; /&gt; Eighteen or more muscles can tilt, rotate, raise, or lower a dog's ear. A dog can identify a sound's location much faster than a human can, as well as hear sounds at four times the distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dog Sense of Hearing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seefido.com/html/dog_sense_of_hearing.htm|title=Dog Sense of Hearing|publisher=seefido.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smell====
[[File:Dog nose.jpg|thumb|The wet, textured [[Olfactory system|nose]] of a dog]]

While the human brain is dominated by a large [[visual cortex]], the dog brain is dominated by an [[olfactory system|olfactory cortex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; The [[olfactory bulb]] in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220&amp;nbsp;million smell-sensitive receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; The [[bloodhound]] exceeds this standard with nearly 300&amp;nbsp;million receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; 

Consequently, it has  been estimated that dogs, in general, have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human's.  In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human's.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhm.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/dogs/formfunction/smell.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080801101136/http://www.nhm.org/exhibitions/dogs/formfunction/smell.html|archivedate=1 August 2008|title=Smell|date=6 May 2004|publisher=nhm.org|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wet nose, or [[rhinarium]], is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkgraaf S.;Vergelijkende dierfysiologie;Bohn, Scheltema en Holkema, 1978, ISBN 90-313-0322-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical characteristics===

====Coat====
{{Main|Coat (dog)}}
[[File:Poligraf Poligrafovich.JPG|thumb|A heavy winter coat with countershading in a [[mixed-breed dog]]]]
The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: &quot;double&quot; being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or &quot;single&quot;, with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,&lt;ref name=&quot;About.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/zoology12/f/countershading.htm|title=What is Counter Shading?|last= Klappenbach|first=Laura|year=2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional &quot;blaze&quot;, stripe, or &quot;star&quot; of white fur on their chest or underside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Juliette|title=The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds|publisher=Paragon Publishing|year=2004|pages=20–23|chapter=Coat Types, Colours and Markings|isbn=0-7525-8276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tail====
{{See also|Docking (dog)|label 1=Docking}}
There are many different shapes for dog [[tail]]s: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others.  In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[docking (dog)|docked]] to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/case4dock.htm|title=The Case for Tail Docking|publisher=Council of Docked Breeds|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some breeds, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/tail-genetics.htm|title= Bourbonnais pointer or ‘short tail pointer’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all dogs are genetically very similar,&lt;ref name=&quot;science2002&quot;/&gt; [[natural selection]] and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor= The Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff|title= Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged|year= 1967|publisher=G&amp;C Merriam Company|location= Springfield, MA U.S.A.|page= 2476|quote= type (4a) the combination of character that fits an individual to a particular use or function (''a strong horse of the draft type'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific classifications of dogs kept by modern [[kennel club]]s. 

Purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from [[purebred (dog)|purebred]] dogs of other breeds,&lt;ref name=&quot;parker&quot;/&gt; but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic.

===Health===
{{Main|Dog health}}
{{Further2|[[:Category:Dog health]]}}
{{See also|CVBD}}

Dogs are susceptible to various diseases, ailments, and poisons, [[zoonosis|some of which can affect humans]]. To defend against many common diseases, dogs are often [[vaccination of dogs|vaccinated]].

[[File:Terrier mixed-breed dog.jpg|thumb|A mixed-breed dog]]
Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] or [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[bloat]], which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworm]], [[cestoda|tapeworm]], [[nematode|roundworm]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworm]].

Dogs are highly susceptible to [[theobromine poisoning]], typically from ingestion of [[chocolate]]. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.

Dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including [[diabetes in dogs|diabetes]], dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dogtime.com/diseases-shared-by-humans-pets-ernie-ward.html|title=Diseases shared by humans and pets|author=Ward, Dr. Ernie|publisher=Dogtime.com|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mortality====
{{Main|Aging in dogs}}

The typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;&gt;

====Predation====
Although wild dogs, like wolves, are [[apex predator]]s, they can be killed in [[territory (animal)|territory]] disputes with wild animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOLVES&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, in areas where both dogs and other large predators live, dogs can be a major food source for big cats or canines. Reports from Croatia indicate wolves kill dogs more frequently than they kill sheep. Wolves in Russia apparently limit feral dog populations. In Wisconsin, more compensation has been paid for dog losses than livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;WOLVES&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Boitani, Luigi; Mech, L.

===Reproduction===

{{Main|Canine reproduction}}
In domestic dogs, [[puberty|sexual maturity]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|title=Sexual Maturity&amp;nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[estrous cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles biannually, during which the body prepares for [[pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[sexual intercourse|copulation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Because the [[ovum|ova]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

Dogs bear their litters roughly 56 to 72 days after [[fertilization]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpvh.com/Articles/36.html|title=Normal gestation in dogs|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six [[puppy|puppies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/overpopulation_estimates.html|title=HSUS Pet Overpopulation Estimates|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, [[toy dog]]s produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French Bulldog]]s, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] in order to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110726070030/http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|title=French Bulldog Pet Care Guide|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutering===
{{Globalize/US|date=March 2012}}
[[File:Wilde huendin am stillen.jpg|right|thumb|A feral dog from [[Sri Lanka]] nursing her four puppies]]
[[Neutering]] refers to the [[Neutering|sterilization]] of animals, usually by removal of [[male dog|the male's testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce [[sex drive]]. Because of the [[overpopulation in companion animals|overpopulation of dogs]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&amp;nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | quote = Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, failure of owners to spay and castrate their animals is a major contributing factor. | last = Mahlow | first = Jane C. | year = 1999 | title = Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 215 | pages = 640–643 | pmid= 10476708 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[animal protection organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

==Intelligence and behavior==

===Intelligence===
{{Main|Dog intelligence}}

[[File:Border Collie liver portrait.jpg|thumb|The [[Border Collie]] is considered to be one of the most intelligent breeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last=Coren | first=Stanley | title=The Intelligence of Dogs: A Guide to the Thoughts, Emotions, and Inner Lives of Our Canine Companions | publisher=Bantam Books | isbn=0-553-37452-4 | year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The domestic dog has a predisposition to exhibit a social intelligence that is uncommon in the animal world.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Dogs are capable of learning in a number of ways, such as through simple [[reinforcement learning|reinforcement]] (e.g., [[classical conditioning|classical]] or [[operant conditioning]]) and by observation.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;

Dogs go through a series of stages of cognitive development. As with [[human]]s, the understanding that objects not being actively perceived still remain in existence (called [[object permanence]]) is not present at birth. It develops as the young dog learns to interact intentionally with objects around it, at roughly 8 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;

Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; This form of intelligence is not peculiar to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to myriad abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies that watched an experienced dog pull a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/dev.420100310|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|volume =10|issue=3|pages= 267–271|year=2004|title = Ontogeny of observational learning in the dog (Canis familiaris)|author=Adler, Leonore Loeb and Adler, Helmut E. |pmid=863122}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dogs can also learn by mimicking human behaviors. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three-quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.&lt;ref name=&quot;hungary&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kubinyi, E., Topal, J., &amp; Miklosi, A. |year=2003|title=Dogs (canis familiaris) learn their owners via observation in a manipulation task|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.117.2.156|volume=117|page=156|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that handing an object between experimenters who then used the object's name in a sentence successfully taught an observing dog each object's name, allowing the dog to subsequently retrieve the item.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckinley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The efficacy of the model-rival method when compared to operant conditioning for training domestic dogs to perform a retrieval-selection task|journal=AABS|year=2003|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00277-0|last1=McKinley|first1=Sue|last2=Young|first2=Robert J|volume=81|issue=4|pages=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sergeant Stubby 3.jpg|thumb|[[Sergeant Stubby]] wearing his uniform and medals. Stubby participated in four offensives and 17 battles.]]
Dogs also demonstrate sophisticated [[social cognition]] by associating behavioral cues with abstract meanings.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; One such class of social cognition involves the understanding that others are conscious agents. Research has shown that dogs are capable of interpreting subtle social cues, and appear to recognize when a human or dog's attention is focused on them. To test this, researchers devised a task in which a reward was hidden underneath one of two buckets. The experimenter then attempted to communicate with the dog to indicate the location of the reward by using a wide range of signals: tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding to the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket.&lt;ref name=&quot;hare&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hare, B., Brown, M., Williamson, C., &amp; Tomasello, M.|year=2002|title=The domestication of social cognition in dogs|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.1072702|volume=298|page=1634|pmid=12446914|month=Nov|first1=B|first2=M|first3=C|first4=M|issue=5598|pages=1634–6|issn=0036-8075|bibcode = 2002Sci...298.1634H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that domestic dogs were better than [[chimpanzee]]s, wolves, and human infants at this task, and even young puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;

Psychology research has shown that humans´ gaze instinctively moves to the left in order to watch the right side of a person's face, which is related to use of right hemisphere brain for facial recognition, including human facial emotions. Research at the [[University of Lincoln]] (2008) shows that dogs share this instinct when meeting a human being, and only when meeting a human being (i.e., not other animals or other dogs). As such they are the only non-[[primate]] species known to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K Guo, C Hall, S Hall, K Meints, D Mills|title=Left gaze bias in human infants, rhesus monkeys, and domestic dogs|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36 ECVP|url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=v070385|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Dogs can read emotion in human faces|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3354028/Dogs-can-read-emotion-in-human-faces.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=29 October 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Coren]], an expert on dog psychology, states that these results demonstrated the social cognition of dogs can exceed that of even our closest genetic relatives, and that this capacity is a recent genetic acquisition that distinguishes the dog from its ancestor, the wolf.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Studies have also investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play change their behavior depending on the attention-state of their partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ach&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play|journal=Journal Animal Cognition|publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|volume=12|year=2009|doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y|author= Horowitz, Alexandra|pages= 107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those studies showed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ach&quot;/&gt;

Coren has also argued that dogs demonstrate a sophisticated theory of mind by engaging in deception, which he supports with a number of anecdotes, including one example wherein a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Although this could have been accidental, Coren suggests that the thief understood that the treat's owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. Together, the empirical data and [[anecdotal evidence]] points to dogs possessing at least a limited form of [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ach&quot;/&gt;

===Behavior===
{{Main|Dog behavior}}
{{Further|:Category:Dog training and behavior}}

Although dogs have been the subject of a great deal of [[behaviorism|behaviorist psychology]] (e.g. [[Classical conditioning|Pavlov's dog]]), they do not enter the world with a psychological &quot;blank slate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Rather, dog behavior is affected by genetic factors as well as environmental factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; Domestic dogs exhibit a number of behaviors and predispositions that were inherited from wolves.&lt;ref name=&quot;coren&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Gray Wolf]] is a [[social animal]] that has evolved a sophisticated means of communication and [[social structure]]. The domestic dog has inherited some of these predispositions, but many of the salient characteristics in dog behavior have been largely shaped by selective breeding by humans. Thus some of these characteristics, such as the dog's highly developed [[social cognition]], are found only in primitive forms in grey wolves.&lt;ref name=&quot;hare&quot;/&gt;

The existence and nature of personality traits in dogs have been studied (15329 dogs of 164 different breeds) and five consistent and stable &quot;narrow traits&quot; identified, described as playfulness, curiosity/fearlessness, chase-proneness, sociability and aggressiveness. A further higher order axis for shyness–boldness was also identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(02)00121-1|last=Kenth Svartberga, Björn Forkman|first1=K|title=Personality traits in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris)|journal=Applied animal behavior science|date=14 June 2002|volume=79|issue=2|pages=133–155|last2=Forkman|first2=Björn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.04.011|last=Svartberg|first1=K|last2=Tapper|first2=I|last3=Temrin|first3=H|last4=Radesater|first4=T|last5=Thorman|first5=S|title=Consistency of personality traits in dogs|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=26 April 2004 2005|month=February|volume=69|issue=2|pages=283–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average sleep time of a dog is said to be 10.1 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;40 Winks?&quot; Jennifer S. Holland,'' National Geographic'' Vol. 220, No. 1.

===Dog growl===
A new study in Budapest, Hungary has found that dogs are able to tell how big another dog is just by listening to its growl. A specific growl is used by dogs to protect their food. The research also shows that dogs do not lie about their size, and this is the first time research has shown animals can determine another’s size by the sound it makes. The test, using images of many kinds of dogs, showed a small and big dog and played a growl. The result, showed that 20 of the 24 test dogs looked at the image of the appropriate-sized dog first and looked at it longest.&lt;ref name=Farag&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faragó|first=T|title=Dogs' Expectation about Signalers' Body Size by Virtue of Their Growls|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2010|volume=5|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015175|pages=e15175|pmid=21179521|pmc=3002277|bibcode = 2010PLoSO...515175F|author2=Pongrácz P|author3=Miklósi Á|author4=Huber L|author5=Virányi Z| last6=Range|first6=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from wolves==
[[File:Timba+1.jpg|thumb|Some dogs, like this [[Tamaskan]], look very much like wolves.]]

===Physical characteristics===
{{Further|Wolf}}
Compared to equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls, 30% smaller brains,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Serpell, James| title=The Domestic Dog; its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people|year=1995|isbn=0-521-42537-9|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

It is thought by certain experts that the dog's limp ears are a result of [[atrophy]] of the jaw muscles.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot; /&gt; The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some [[Inuit]] tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot; /&gt;

===Behavior===

Dogs tend to be poorer than wolves at [[observational learning]], being more responsive to [[operant conditioning|instrumental conditioning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot; /&gt; Feral dogs show little of the complex social structure or [[dominance hierarchy]] present in wolf packs. For example, unlike wolves, the dominant alpha pairs of a feral dog pack do not force the other members to wait for their turn on a meal when scavenging off a dead ungulate as the whole family is free to join in. For dogs, other members of their kind are of no help in locating food items, and are more like competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot; /&gt; 

Feral dogs are primarily scavengers, with studies showing that unlike their wild cousins, they are poor [[ungulate]] hunters, having little impact on wildlife populations where they are [[sympatric speciation|sympatric]]. However, feral dogs have been reported to be effective hunters of reptiles in the [[Galápagos Islands]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author=Serpell, James| title=The Domestic Dog; its evolution, behaviour and interactions with people|year=1995|isbn=0-521-42537-9|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location= Cambridge|page= 267}}&lt;/ref&gt; and free ranging pet dogs are more prone to predatory behavior toward wild animals.

Domestic dogs can be [[monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pal&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pal SK |title=Parental care in free-ranging dogs, Canis familiaris |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=31–47 |year=2005 |month=January |doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2004.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breeding in feral packs can be, but does not have to be restricted to a dominant alpha pair (such things also occur in wolf packs).&lt;ref&gt;Günther Bloch: Die Pizza-Hunde. ISBN 978-3-440-10986-1&lt;/ref&gt; Male dogs are unusual among canids by the fact that they mostly seem to play no role in raising their puppies, and do not kill the young of other females to increase their own reproductive success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot; /&gt; Some sources say that dogs differ from wolves and most other large canid species by the fact that they do not regurgitate food for their young, nor the young of other dogs in the same [[territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DOGS&quot; /&gt;

However, this difference was not observed in all domestic dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females for the young as well as care for the young by the males has been observed in domestic dogs, [[dingo]]s as well as in other feral or semi-feral dogs. Regurgitating of food by the females and direct choosing of only one mate has been observed even in those semi-feral dogs of direct domestic dog ancestry. Also regurgitating of food by males has been observed in free-ranging domestic dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Trumler, Mit dem Hund auf du; Zum Verständnis seines Wesens und Verhaltens; 4. Auflage Januar 1996; R. Piper GmbH &amp; Co. KG, München&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trainability===
Dogs display much greater tractability than tame wolves, and are, in general, much more responsive to coercive techniques involving fear, aversive stimuli, and force than wolves, which are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards.&lt;ref name=&quot;training&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html| title= Are wolves and wolfdog hybrids trainable?|publisher=Wolf Park| accessdate=30 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080615124627/http://www.wolfpark.org/wolfdogs/Poster_section7.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike tame wolves, dogs tend to respond more to voice than hand signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;training2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html| title= Wolf Training and Socialisation: Example #1|publisher=Wolf Park| accessdate=30 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080210012443/http://www.wolfpark.org/training/Example-1.html |archivedate = 10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
In mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherman, Josepha |title=Storytelling: An Encyclopedia of Mythology and Folklore|date=August 2008|publisher=Sharpe Reference|isbn=978-0-7656-8047-1|pages=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cerberus]] is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of [[Hades]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Norse mythology]], a bloody, four-eyed dog called [[Garmr]] guards [[Helheim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Persian mythology]], two four-eyed dogs guard the [[Chinvat Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In [[Philippine mythology]], [[Kimat]] who is the pet of [[Tadaklan]], god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. In [[Welsh mythology]], [[Annwn]] is guarded by [[Cŵn Annwn]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt;

In Judaism and Islam, dogs are viewed as unclean scavengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt; In Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2008&quot;/&gt;

The '''Southern Cross Expedition''', officially known as the '''British Antarctic Expedition 1898–1900''',  was the first British venture of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]], and the forerunner of the more celebrated journeys of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]]. The brainchild of the Norwegian-born, half-British explorer and schoolmaster [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], it was the first expedition to over-winter on the Antarctic mainland, the first to visit the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]] since [[James Clark Ross]] in 1839–43, and the first to effect a landing on the Barrier's surface. It also pioneered the use of dogs and sledges in Antarctic travel.

The expedition was privately financed by the British magazine publisher [[George Newnes|Sir George Newnes]]. Taken south in the ship [[SS Southern Cross (1886)|''Southern Cross'']] in August 1898, Borchgrevink's party spent the winter of 1899 at [[Cape Adare]], the north-west extremity of the [[Ross Sea]] coastline. Here they carried out an extensive programme of scientific observations, although opportunities for inland exploration were severely restricted by the mountainous and glaciated terrain surrounding the base. In January 1900 the party left Cape Adare in ''Southern Cross'' to explore the Ross Sea, following the route taken by Ross sixty years earlier. They reached the Great Ice Barrier, where a team of three made the first [[sled]]ge journey on the Barrier surface, during which a new [[Farthest South]] record latitude was established at 78°50′S.

On its return to England the expedition was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption of a role they envisaged for their own [[Discovery Expedition|National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition]]. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, [[Roald Amundsen]], conqueror of the [[South Pole]] in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had opened the way for all the expeditions that followed.

== Background ==
[[File:Newnes-Spy-1894.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Drawing of a heavily-bearded man, hands in pockets, wearing a black tailed coat, striped trousers, waistcoat and watch chain.|A cartoon depiction of Sir George Newnes.]]

Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian father and an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, where he worked on survey teams in the interior before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web | title = Borchgrevink, Carsten Egeberg (1864–1934) | url = http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070353b.htm|publisher = Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition | accessdate = 10 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by [[Henryk Bull]] in the whaler ''Antarctic'', which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the [[Ross Sea]]. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and claimed to be the first men to set foot on the Antarctic continent—although the American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] believed he had landed on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] in 1821.&lt;ref name=ForgottenEx&gt;{{cite web | title = Norway's Forgotten Explorer | url = http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-explorer/ | publisher = Antarctic Heritage Trust | accessdate = 10 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An Antarctic Timeline | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm | publisher = www.south-pole.com | accessdate = 29 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also visited [[Possession Islands|Possession Island]] in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3&gt;{{cite web | title = Antarctic Explorers – Carsten Borchgrevink | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm | publisher = www.south-pole.com | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge [[seabird colony|penguin rookery]] providing a ready supply of fresh food and [[blubber]], could serve as a base at which a future expedition could [[overwinter]] and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-intro&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Preston14&gt;Preston, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined that he would lead such an expedition himself, after his return from Cape Adare Borchgrevink spent much of the next three years attempting to gain financial backing in Australia and England. Despite some encouragement from the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), whose International Congress he addressed in 1895, he was initially unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=SouthPole1&gt;{{cite web | title = Antarctic Explorers – Carsten Borchgrevink | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm | publisher = www.south-pole.com | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The RGS was in fact harbouring plans of its own for a large-scale National Antarctic Expedition&lt;ref&gt;This would in due course become the [[Discovery Expedition]], led by Captain Scott.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in search of funds; Borchgrevink was regarded by RGS president [[Sir Clements Markham]] as a foreign interloper and a rival for funding.&lt;ref name=Preston14/&gt; However, Borchgrevink eventually managed to persuade publisher Sir [[George Newnes]] (whose business rival [[Alfred Harmsworth]] was backing Markham's venture) to meet the full cost of his expedition, some £40,000 (approximately £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|40000|1898|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{inflation-fn|UK}}&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Measuringworth | url = http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/ | publisher = The Institute for the Measurement of Worth | accessdate = 19 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gift infuriated Markham and the RGS, since Newnes's donation, had it come their way, would have been enough &quot;to get the National Expedition on its legs&quot;.&lt;ref name=SouthPole2&gt;{{cite web | title = Antarctic Explorers – Carsten Borchgrevink | url = http://www.south-pole.com/p0000087.htm | publisher = www.south-pole.com | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Newnes made one stipulation: Borchgrevink's expedition must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to this, even though only two of the entire expedition party were British.&lt;ref name=Jones59&gt;Jones, pp. 59–60. Another member of the shore party, [[Louis Bernacchi]], was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham,&lt;ref name=Crane74&gt;Crane, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; who chastised RGS librarian [[Hugh Robert Mill]] for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.&lt;ref name= Jones59/&gt;
There, Mill had toasted the success of the expedition in stirring terms, calling it &quot;a reproach to human enterprise&quot; that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through &quot;the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Borchgrevink | first = Carsten | title = First on the Antarctic Continent | url = http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition#PPP1,M1 | publisher = George Newnes Ltd | year = 1901 | accessdate= 11 August 2008 | page = 25 | isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expedition objectives ===
Borchgrevink's expedition objectives comprised commercial, scientific and geographical goals.

For his expedition's ship, Borchgrevink purchased a steam whaler, ''Pollux'', that had been built in the yard of [[Colin Archer]], the renowned Norwegian shipbuilder.&lt;ref name=Borch10&gt;{{cite book | last = Borchgrevink | first = Carsten | title = First on the Antarctic Continent | url = http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition#PPP1,M1 | publisher = George Newnes Ltd | year = 1901 | accessdate = 11 August 2008 | pages = 10–11 | isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archer had designed and built [[Fridtjof Nansen|Nansen's]] ship ''[[Fram]]'', which in 1896 had returned unscathed from its long drift in the northern polar ocean during Nansen's &quot;Farthest North&quot; expedition, 1893–96.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pollux'', which Borchgrevink immediately renamed ''Southern Cross'',&lt;ref name=ForgottenExpedition/&gt; was [[barque|barque-rigged]], 520&amp;nbsp;tons [[gross tonnage|gross]], and {{convert|146|ft|m}} overall length.&lt;ref name=Borch10/&gt; Engines were designed to Borchgrevink's specification, and fitted before the ship left Norway.&lt;ref name= Borch10/&gt; Although Markham cast doubts on her seaworthiness (perhaps to thwart Borchgrevink's departure),&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston, p. 16&quot;&gt;Preston, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; the ship fulfilled all that was required of her in Antarctic waters.

The shore party of ten who were to winter at Cape Adare consisted of Borchgrevink, five scientists, a medical officer, a cook who also served as a general assistant, and two dog drivers. Of this party, five were Norwegians, two were English, one was Australian and two, the dog experts, were [[Sami people|Samis]] from Northern Norway, sometimes described in expedition accounts as [[Sami people|Lapp]]s or &quot;Finns&quot;.&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;anta-canterbury-people&quot;/&gt; Among the scientists was the Tasmanian [[Louis Bernacchi]], who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the [[Melbourne Observatory]]. He had been appointed to the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]], 1897–99, but had been unable to take up his post; the expedition's ship, ''[[Belgica]]'', had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south, leaving Bernacchi stranded.&lt;ref name=Borch13/&gt; Bernacchi then travelled to London and secured a place on Borchgrevink's scientific staff.&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; His chronicle of the Southern Cross Expedition, which was published in 1901,&lt;ref&gt;''To the South Polar Regions'', Hurst &amp; Blackett, London 1901&lt;/ref&gt; was critical of aspects of Borchgrevink's leadership, but defended the expedition's scientific achievements.&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt; In 1901 Bernacchi went back to Antarctica as a physicist on  Scott's ''Discovery'' Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borchgrevink's men who was to serve Scott's expedition (in command of ''Discovery'''s relief ship ''Morning'') was Englishman [[William Colbeck (seaman)|William Colbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Crane, pp. 232–33&lt;/ref&gt; an experienced seaman who held a [[Lieutenant#Naval rank|lieutenant]]'s commission in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]].&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; In preparation for the Southern Cross Expedition Colbeck had taken a course in magnetism at [[Kew Observatory]].&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt;

Borchgrevink's assistant zoologist was Hugh Blackwell Evans, a vicar's son from [[Bristol]], who had spent three years on a cattle ranch in Canada and had also been on a [[seal hunting|sealing]] voyage to the [[Kerguelen Islands]].&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt; The chief zoologist was [[Nicolai Hanson]], a graduate from the [[University of Oslo|University of Christiania]]. Also in the shore party was Herlof Klovstad, the expedition's medical officer, whose previous appointment had been to a lunatic asylum in [[Bergen]].&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt; The others were Anton Fougner, scientific assistant and general handyman; Kolbein Ellifsen, cook and general assistant; and the two Sami dog-handlers, Per Savio and Ole Must.&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt; Savio and Must, at 21 and 20 years of age respectively, were the youngest of the party.&lt;ref name=ForgottenEx/&gt; Borchgrevink later described Savio as &quot;well-known for his faithful character, hardihood and intelligence&quot;.&lt;ref name= Borch13/&gt;

The ship's company, under Captain Bernard Jensen, consisted of 19&amp;nbsp;Norwegian seamen and one Swedish steward. Jensen was an experienced ice navigator in Arctic and Antarctic waters, and had been with Borchgrevink on Bull's ''Antarctic'' voyage in 1894–95.&lt;ref name=Borch13&gt;{{cite book | last = Borchgrevink | first = Carsten | title = First on the Antarctic Continent | url = http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition#PPP1,M1 | publisher = George Newnes Ltd | year = 1901 | accessdate = 11 August 2008 | pages = 13–19 | isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voyage ==
=== Cape Adare ===

''Southern Cross'' left London on 23 August 1898, after inspection by [[King George V of the United Kingdom|HRH the Duke of York]] (the future King George V), who presented a [[Union Jack|Union Flag]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot; /&gt; Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions the ship was carrying Siberian sledge dogs, the first to be taken on an Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-equip&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Equipment and Personnel)&lt;/ref&gt; After final provisioning in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], ''Southern Cross'' sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the [[pack ice]] for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt;

Cape Adare had been discovered by Antarctic explorer [[James Clark Ross]] during his [[James Clark Ross#Antarctic explorer|1839–43 expedition]]. It lies at the end of a long [[promontory]]; below the Cape is a large triangular shingle [[Intertidal zone|foreshore]], where Bull and Borchgrevink had made their brief landing in 1895. This foreshore is the site of one of the largest [[Adelie penguin]] rookeries on the entire continent and, as Borchgrevink had remarked in 1895, &quot;On this particular spot, there is ample room for houses, tents and provisions&quot;.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-intro/&gt; The abundance of penguins would provide both a winter larder and a fuel source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston, p. 14&quot;&gt;Preston, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Huskies 2000-08-24.jpg|thumb|left|alt= A group of eight dogs, all with thich fur, pointed ears and sharp snouts, standing on rocks covered with a light snowfall|The expedition was the first to use dogs in the Antarctic.]]
Unloading began on 17 February. First ashore were the 75 dogs,&lt;ref name= ForEx&gt;{{cite web | title = The Forgotten Expedition | url = http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/english/forgotten-expedition | publisher = Antarctic Heritage Trust | accessdate = 13 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their two Sami handlers, who remained with them and thus became the first men to spend a night on the Antarctic continent.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Arrival at Cape Adare)&lt;/ref&gt; During the next twelve days the rest of the equipment and supplies were landed, and two prefabricated huts were erected, one as living quarters and the other for storage.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-build&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (First Buildings)&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first buildings erected on the continent. A third structure was contrived from spare materials, to serve as a magnetic observation hut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston, p. 14&quot;/&gt; The &quot;living hut&quot; was small to serve as accommodation for ten men, and seemingly precarious—Bernacchi later described it as &quot;fifteen feet square, lashed down by cables to the rocky shore&quot;.&lt;ref name= Crane153&gt;Crane, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-build/&gt; By 2 March the base, christened &quot;Camp Ridley&quot; after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name,&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt; was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised. That day, ''Southern Cross'' departed for Australia, to spend the winter there.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-arrival/&gt;

Inside the living hut were two small ante-rooms, one used as a photographic [[darkroom]], the other for [[taxidermy]]. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and shuttered window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated the centre of the hut.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-build/&gt; During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.&lt;ref name= SouthPole2/&gt;

=== Antarctic winter ===

As the winter season took hold, the party was almost completely restricted to the cramped living quarters. This proved to be a difficult time; Bernacchi wrote of rising boredom and irritation: &quot;Officers and men, ten of us in all, found tempers wearing thin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane153&quot;/&gt; During this period of tension and confinement, Borchgrevink's qualities as a commander were found wanting; he was, wrote Bernacchi, &quot;in many respects&amp;nbsp;... not a good leader&quot;.&lt;ref name= Crane74/&gt; Polar historian [[Ranulph Fiennes]] writes that in conditions of &quot;democratic anarchy&quot;, dirt, disorder and inactivity were the order of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Fiennes, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Borchgrevink was not a trained scientist, and his incompetence with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern to some of the party.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Departure of the Expedition)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Life at Camp Ridley)&lt;/ref&gt; During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fumes as they slept.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthPole3&quot;/&gt;

The party was well-supplied with a variety of basic foodstuffs—butter, tea and coffee, herrings, sardines, cheeses, soup, tinned tripe, plum pudding, dry potatoes and vegetables.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt; However, there were soon complaints about the lack of luxuries, Colbeck noting that &quot;all the tinned fruits supplied for the land party were either eaten on the passage or left on board for the [ship's] crew&quot;.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt; There was also a shortage of tobacco, in spite of an intended provision of half a ton (500&amp;nbsp;kg); only a quantity of chewing tobacco was landed.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-life/&gt;

The zoologist, [[Nicolai Hanson]], had fallen ill during the winter. On 14 October 1899 he died, apparently of an intestinal disorder, and became the first person to be buried on the Antarctic continent. The grave was dynamited from the frozen ground at the summit of the Cape.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-burial&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (First Burial)&lt;/ref&gt; Bernacchi wrote: &quot;There amidst profound silence and peace, there is nothing to disturb that eternal sleep except the flight of seabirds&quot;.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Hanson left a wife, and a baby daughter born after he left for the Antarctic.&lt;ref name= ForgottenEx/&gt;

As winter gave way to spring, the party prepared for more ambitious inland journeys using the dogs and sledges. However, their base camp was cut off from the continent's interior by high mountain ranges, and journeys along the coastline were frustrated by unsafe sea ice. These factors severely restricted the extent of their exploration, which was largely confined to the vicinity of Robertson Bay.&lt;ref name= ForEx/&gt; Here, a small island was discovered, which was called [[Duke of York Island, Antarctica|Duke of York Island]], after the expedition's patron.&lt;ref name=Borch6&gt;{{cite book | last = Borchgrevink | first = Carsten | title = First on the Antarctic Continent | url = http://books.google.com/?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Southern+Cross+Expedition#PPP1,M1 | publisher = George Newnes Ltd | year = 1901 | accessdate = 11 August 2008 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-905838-41-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later this find was dismissed by members of Scott's Discovery Expedition, who claimed that the island &quot;did not exist&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; but its position has since been confirmed at 71°38′S, 170°04′E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) | url = http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:5:17644683241013707961::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:4153 | publisher = United States Geographic Survey | accessdate = 18 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ross Sea exploration ===
''Southern Cross'' returned to Cape Adare from Australia on 28 January 1900.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/&gt; Borchgrevink began  dismantling the camp and taking its remaining supplies on board, but soon abandoned this;  on 2 February he took the ship south into the Ross Sea.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-depart/&gt; Evidence of a hasty and disorderly departure from Cape Adare was noted two years later, when the site was visited by members of the Discovery Expedition, after which [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]] wrote; &quot;...&amp;nbsp;heaps of refuse all around, and a mountain of provision boxes, dead birds, seals, dogs, sledging gear&amp;nbsp;... and heaven knows what else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson diary, 9 January 1902, pp. 93–95&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ross Ice Shelf 1997.jpg|thumb|250px|alt= Dark sea in the foreground extends to a long ice ridge that stretches across the picture|The edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, or &quot;Great Ice Barrier&quot;, where Borchgrevink landed in 1900 to set a new Farthest South record]]
The first port of call in the Ross Sea was Possession Island, where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered.&lt;ref name=SouthPole3/&gt; They then proceeded southwards, following the [[Victoria Land]] coast and discovering further islands, one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham, whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;Huxley, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; ''Southern Cross'' then sailed on to [[Ross Island]], observed the volcano [[Mount Erebus]], and attempted a landing at [[Cape Crozier]], at the foot of [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]]. Here, Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wave caused by a [[Ice calving|calving]] or breakaway of ice from the adjacent [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]].&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Following the path of [[James Clark Ross]] sixty years previously, they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge, to find the inlet where, in 1843, Ross had reached his [[Farthest South|farthest south]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles (50 km) south since Ross's time, which meant that the ship were already south of Ross's record.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; However, Borchgrevink wished to make a landing on the Barrier itself. In the vicinity of Ross's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible.&lt;ref name= Amundsen/&gt; On 16 February he, Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge, ascended to the Barrier surface, and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78°50′S, a new Farthest South record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston, p. 14&quot;/&gt; They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface, earning Amundsen's approbation: &quot;We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed&quot;.&lt;ref name= Amundsen&gt;Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;
Close to the same spot ten years later, Amundsen would establish his base camp &quot;Framheim&quot;, prior to his successful South Pole journey.&lt;ref&gt;Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 167–68&lt;/ref&gt;

On the passage northward, ''Southern Cross'' halted at [[Franklin Island (Antarctica)|Franklin Island]], off the Victoria Land coast, and made a series of magnetic calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from [[Bluff, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name= ForEx/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:MountMelbourne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt= Distant view over an ice-covered sea of a conical mountain|Mount Melbourne, on Victoria Land, at the foot of which Borchgrevink discovered &quot;an excellent camping place&quot;]]
''Southern Cross'' returned to England in June 1900,&lt;ref&gt;Stonehouse, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; to a cool welcome. In geographical circles there was still resentment at Borchgrevink's coup in obtaining the backing of Newnes, but public attention was, in any event, distracted by the preparations for the upcoming Discovery Expedition, due to sail the following year.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; Borchgrevink meanwhile pronounced his voyage a great success, stating: &quot;The Antarctic regions might be another [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondyke]]&quot;—in terms of the prospects for fishing, sealing, and mineral extraction.&lt;ref name=anta-canterbury-results&gt;{{cite web | title = The Southern Cross Expedition | url = http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/sth_cross/intro.html | publisher = www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz | accessdate = 10 August 2008}} (Results)&lt;/ref&gt; He had proved that it was possible for a resident expedition to survive an Antarctic winter, and had made a series of geographical discoveries. These included the new islands in Robertson's Bay and the Ross Sea, and the first landings on Franklin Island, Coulman Island, Ross Island and the Great Ice Barrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot;/&gt; The survey of the Victoria Land coast had revealed the &quot;important geographical discovery&amp;nbsp;... of the Southern Cross Fjord, as well as the excellent camping place at the foot of [[Mount Melbourne]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot;/&gt; The most significant exploration achievement, he claimed, was the scaling of the Great Ice Barrier and the journey to &quot;the furthest south ever reached by man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot;/&gt;

Borchgrevink's account of the expedition, ''First on the Antarctic Continent'', was published the following year; the English edition, much of which may have been embroidered by Newnes's staff, was criticised for its &quot;journalistic&quot; style and for its bragging tone.&lt;ref name= adb/&gt;&lt;ref name= Huxley/&gt; The author, whom commentators recognised was &quot;not known for either his modesty or his tact&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston, p. 16&quot;/&gt; embarked on a lecture tour of England and Scotland, but the reception was generally poor.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt;

Hugh Robert Mill stated that while the scientific results of the expedition were not so great as expected, many of Hanson's notes having mysteriously disappeared, the expedition was &quot;interesting as a dashing piece of scientific work&quot;.&lt;ref name= anta-canterbury-results/&gt; The meteorological and magnetic conditions of Victoria Land had been recorded for a full year; the location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated (though not visited); samples of the continent's natural fauna and flora, and of its geology, had been collected. Borchgrevink also claimed the discovery of new insect and shallow-water fauna species, proving &quot;bi-polarity&quot; (existence of species in proximity to the North and South poles).&lt;ref name=&quot;Borch6&quot;/&gt;

The geographical establishments in Britain and abroad were slow to give formal recognition to the expedition. The Royal Geographical Society gave Borchgrevink a fellowship, and other medals and honours eventually followed from Norway, Denmark and the United States,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; but the expedition's achievements were not widely recognised. Markham persisted in his attacks on Borchgrevink, describing him as cunning and unprincipled;&lt;ref&gt;Riffenburgh, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's warm tribute was a lone approving voice. Scott's biographer David Crane surmises that if Borchgrevink had been a British naval officer, his expedition would have been treated differently in Britain, but &quot;a Norwegian seaman/schoolmaster was never going to be taken seriously&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crane74&quot;/&gt; A belated recognition came in 1930, long after Markham's death, when the Royal Geographical Society presented Borchgrevink with its Patron's Medal. It admitted that &quot;justice had not been done at the time to the pioneer work of the ''Southern Cross'' expedition&quot;, and that the magnitude of the difficulties it had overcome had previously been underestimated.&lt;ref name= SouthPole3/&gt; After the expedition, Borchgrevink lived quietly, largely out of the public eye. He died in Oslo on 21 April 1934.&lt;ref name= adb/&gt;

[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|upright|Personification of knowledge ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''Επιστημη'', [[Episteme]]) in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
'''Knowledge''' is a familiarity with someone or something, which can include [[fact]]s, [[information]],  [[description]]s,  or [[skills]] acquired through [[experience]] or [[education]]. It can refer to the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1261368#m_en_us1261368&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy]], the study of knowledge is called [[epistemology]]; the philosopher [[Plato]] famously defined knowledge as &quot;[[justified true belief]].&quot; However, no single agreed upon definition of knowledge exists, though there are numerous theories to explain it. The following quote from Bertrand Russell's &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot; illustrates the difficulty in defining knowledge: &quot;The question how knowledge should be defined is perhaps the most important and difficult of the three with which we shall deal. This may seem surprising: at first sight it might be thought that knowledge might be defined as belief which is in agreement with the facts. The trouble is that no one knows what a belief is, no one knows what a fact is, and no one knows what sort of agreement between them would make a belief true. Let us begin with belief.&quot;

Knowledge acquisition involves complex [[Cognition|cognitive]] processes: perception, communication, association and reasoning; while knowledge is also said to be related to the capacity of ''acknowledgment'' in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Cavell, &quot;Knowing and Acknowledging,&quot; ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), 238–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of knowledge==
[[File:Knowledge-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Robert Reid (painter)|Robert Reid]], ''Knowledge'' (1896). [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
{{see also|Epistemology}}
{{cquote2
|The eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophy's core was &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their ''foundation''… Without this idea of a &quot;theory of knowledge,&quot; it is hard to imagine what &quot;philosophy&quot; could have been in the age of modern science.|[[Richard Rorty]]|''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The  definition of knowledge is a matter of on-going [[debate]] among [[philosopher]]s in the field of [[epistemology]]. The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;In Plato's ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of ''knowledge'': knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account. Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt; specifies that a [[statement (logic)|statement]] must meet three [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in order to be considered knowledge: it must be [[theory of justification|justified]], [[truth|true]], and [[belief|believed]]. Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as [[Gettier case]] examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn|Simon Blackburn's]] additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. [[Richard Kirkham]] suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centenary.edu/attachments/philosophy/aizawa/courses/epistemologyf2008/kirkham1984.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this approach, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] observed, following [[Moore's paradox]], that one can say &quot;He believes it, but it isn't so&quot;, but not &quot;He knows it, but it isn't so&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[On Certainty]]'', remark 42&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way &quot;knowledge&quot; is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]]. Following this idea, &quot;knowledge&quot; has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk-Mazouz, N. (2008): &quot;Internet and the flow of knowledge&quot;, in: Hrachovec, H.; Pichler, A. (Hg.): Philosophy of the Information Society. Proceedings of the 30. International Ludwig Wittgenstein Symposium Kirchberg am Wechsel, Austria 2007. Volume 2, Frankfurt, Paris, Lancaster, New Brunswik: Ontos, S. 215–232. http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/philo/fileadmin/doc/pdf/gottschalk/ngm-internetflow-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communicating knowledge==
[[File:Los portadores de la antorcha.jpg|thumb|''Los portadores de la antorcha'' &lt;br&gt; Sculpture by [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]] about the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next &lt;br&gt;([[Complutense University of Madrid|Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain]])]]
[[Symbolic linguistic representation|Symbolic representation]]s can be used to indicate meaning and can be thought of as a dynamic process. Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one [[wikt:ascription|ascription]] process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and [[semioticians]] construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

While many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays ''[[Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology|Technopoly]]'' Neil Postman demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, pp 73). In this excerpt the scholar [[Socrates]] recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word. In this story, Theuth presents his new invention &quot;writing&quot; to King Thamus, telling Thamus that his new invention &quot;will improve both the wisdom and memory of the Egyptians&quot; (Postman, Neil (1992) Technopoly, Vintage, New York, pp 74). King Thamus is skeptical of this new invention and rejects it as a tool of recollection rather than retained knowledge. He argues that the written word will infect the Egyptian people with fake knowledge as they will be able to attain facts and stories from an external source and will no longer be forced to mentally retain large quantities of knowledge themselves (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York,pp 74).

Andrew Robinson also highlights, in his work ''The Origins of Writing'', the possibility for writing to be used to spread false information and therefore the ability of the written word to decrease social knowledge (Robinson, Andrew (2003) ''The Origins of Writing'' in Crowley and Heyer (eds) Communication in History: Technology, Culture, Society, Boston pp 34). People are often internalizing new information which they perceive to be knowledge but in reality fill their minds with false knowledge.  

The above points are moot in the modern world. Verbal communication lends itself to the spread of falsehoods much more so than written, as there is no record of exactly what was said or who originally said it (usually neither the source nor the content can be verified). Gossip and rumors are common examples.  As to value of writing, the extent of human knowledge is now so great that it is only possible to record it and to communicate it through writing. Major libraries today can have millions of books of knowledge (in addition to works of fiction). It is only recently that audio and video technology for recording knowledge have become available and the use of these still requires replay equipment and electricity.  Verbal teaching and handing down of knowledge is limited to those few who would have contact with the transmitter person - far too limited for today's world.  Writing is still the most available and most universal of all forms of recording and transmitting knowledge.  It stands unchallenged as mankind's primary technology of knowledge transfer down through the ages and to all cultures and languages of the world.

==Situated knowledge==
Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;Haraway, Donna 1998. ''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods of generating knowledge, such as [[trial and error]], or learning from [[experience]], tend to create highly situational knowledge. One of the main attributes of the [[scientific method]] is that the theories it generates are much less situational than knowledge gained by other methods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
Situational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Knowledge generated through experience is called knowledge &quot;a posteriori&quot;, meaning afterwards. The pure existence of a term like &quot;a posteriori&quot; means this also has a counterpart. In this case that is knowledge &quot;a priori&quot;, meaning before. The knowledge prior to any experience means that there are certain &quot;assumptions&quot; that one takes for granted. For example if you are being told about a [[chair]] it is clear to you that the chair is in [[space]], that it is [[three dimensional space|3D]]. This knowledge is not knowledge that one can &quot;forget&quot;, even someone suffering from amnesia experiences the world in 3D. See also: ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori and a posteriori]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

==Partial knowledge==
One discipline of [[epistemology]] focuses on [[dispersed knowledge|partial knowledge]]. In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

This idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.

==Scientific knowledge==

The development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge is acquired. To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]&quot;, {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794–6}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.  
&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy]].  As science itself has developed, knowledge has developed a broader usage which has been developing within biology/psychology—discussed elsewhere as [[meta-epistemology]], or [[genetic epistemology]], and to some extent related to &quot;[[theory of cognitive development]]&quot;. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Image:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], &quot;[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]&quot;]] Note that &quot;[[epistemology]]&quot; is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is &quot;the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.&quot; [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, &quot;[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]&quot;, is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans — and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to (ii)&amp;nbsp;''Society-as-such'', as in (e.g.) &quot;the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture&quot; (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains—e.g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically &quot;transcendental&quot; and &quot;a priori&quot; — a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of &quot;''[[infinite regress]]''&quot; can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited &quot;pseudo-transcendentals&quot; inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations. See also &quot;[[Tacit knowledge]]&quot;.

Other biological domains where &quot;knowledge&quot; might be said to reside, include: (iii) the ''immune system'', and (iv) in the ''DNA of the genetic code''. See the list of four &quot;epistemological domains&quot;: &amp;nbsp; [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). &quot;The rationality of scientific revolutions&quot;; in Rom Harré (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''. Clarendon Press: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and Traill (2008:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ondwelle.com/OSM02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Table&amp;nbsp;S, page&amp;nbsp;31)—also references by both to [[Niels Kaj Jerne|Niels Jerne]].

Such considerations seem to call for a separate definition of &quot;knowledge&quot; to cover the biological systems. For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:
* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').
* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of &quot;the outside world&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;outside world&quot; could include other subsystems within the same organism—e.g. different &quot;mental levels&quot; corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].&lt;/ref&gt; or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).
* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.

Scientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious meaning of knowledge==
In many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831
|title=Part Three, No. 1831

|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: &quot;And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil…&quot; ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})

In [[Gnosticism]] divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained. In [[Thelema]] knowledge and conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel is the purpose of life.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

विद्या दान (Vidya Daan) i.e. knowledge sharing is a major part of [[Dāna|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva Knowledge Donation is the primary donation]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''. ''Paroksh Gyan'' (also spelled ''Paroksha-Jnana'') is secondhand knowledge: knowledge obtained from books, hearsay, etc. ''Prataksh Gyan'' (also spelled ''Prataksha-Jnana'') is the knowledge borne of direct experience, i.e., knowledge that one discovers for oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Islam, knowledge (Arabic: علم, ''ʿilm'') is given great significance. &quot;The Knowing&quot; (''al-ʿAlīm'') is one of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names]] reflecting distinct attributes of [[God in Islam|God]]. The [[Qur'an]] asserts that knowledge comes from God ({{cite quran|2|239|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and various ''[[hadith]]'' encourage the acquisition of knowledge. [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said &quot;Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave&quot; and &quot;Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets&quot;. Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title ''[[ulema|alim]]'', meaning &quot;knowledgable&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In [[Jewish]] tradition, knowledge ([[Hebrew]]: דעת ''da'ath'') is considered one of the most valuable traits a person can acquire. Observant Jews recite three times a day in the [[Amidah]] &quot;Favor us with knowledge, understanding and discretion that come from you. Exalted are you, Existent-One, the gracious giver of knowledge.&quot; The [[Tanakh]] states, &quot;A wise man gains power, and a man of knowledge maintains power&quot;, and &quot;knowledge is chosen above gold&quot;.

'''Love''' is an [[emotion]] of a strong [[affection]] and personal [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;&gt;''Oxford Illustrated American Dictionary'' (1998) + ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Love is also said to be a [[virtue]] representing all of human [[kindness]], [[compassion]], and affection —&quot;the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love Merriam Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Love may describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 1956&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; &quot;The Art of Loving&quot;, Harper Perennial (1956), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, love refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from pleasure (&quot;I loved that meal&quot;) to [[interpersonal attraction]] (&quot;I love my partner&quot;). &quot;Love&quot; may refer specifically to the passionate desire and intimacy of [[romance (love)|romantic love]], to the sexual love of [[eros (concept)|eros]], to the emotional closeness of [[familial love|familial]] love, to the [[platonic love]] that defines [[friendship]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PlatonicSchool&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristeller |first=Paul Oskar |title=Renaissance Thought and the Arts: Collected Essays |publisher=Princeton University |year=1980 |isbn=0-691-02010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the profound [[Henosis|oneness]] or devotion of [[Religious views on love|religious love]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gita&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Mascaró |first=Juan |title=The Bhagavad Gita |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2003 |isbn=0-14-044918-3}} (J. Mascaró, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;, or to a concept of '''love''' that encompasses all of those feelings. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define,  compared to other emotional states.

Love in its various forms acts as a major facilitator of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the [[creative arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love|url=http://www.slideshare.net/azharabbas/just-love|accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love may be understood as part of the survival instinct, a function to keep human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher&quot;&gt;Helen Fisher. ''Why we love: the nature and chemistry of romantic love''. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
{{Love table}}
The word &quot;love&quot; can have a variety of related but distinct meanings in different contexts. Often, other languages use multiple words to express some of the different concepts that English relies mainly on &quot;love&quot; to encapsulate; one example is the plurality of [[Greek words for love|Greek words for &quot;love.&quot;]] [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] in conceptualizing love thus make it doubly difficult to establish any universal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the nature or [[essence]] of love is a subject of frequent debate, different aspects of the word can be clarified by determining what ''isn't'' love. As a general expression of positive sentiment (a stronger form of ''like''), love is commonly contrasted with [[hate]] (or neutral [[apathy]]); as a less sexual and more emotionally intimate form of romantic attachment, love is commonly contrasted with [[lust]]; and as an interpersonal relationship with romantic overtones, love is sometimes contrasted with [[friendship]], although the word ''love'' is often applied to close friendships.

When discussed in the abstract, ''love'' usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience felt by a person for another person. Love often involves caring for or identifying with a person or thing (cf. [[vulnerability and care theory of love]]), including oneself (cf. [[narcissism]]). In addition to cross-cultural differences in understanding love, ideas about love have also changed greatly over time. Some historians date modern conceptions of romantic love to courtly Europe during or after [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], although the prior existence of romantic attachments is attested by ancient love poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.TrueOpenLove.org/reference/AncientLovePoetry.html
|title=Ancient Love Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the complex and abstract nature of love, discourse on love is commonly reduced to a [[thought-terminating cliché]], and there are a number of common [[proverb]]s regarding love, from [[Virgil|Virgil's]] &quot;[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love conquers all]]&quot; to [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[All You Need Is Love]]&quot;. [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], following [[Aristotle]], defines love as &quot;to will the good of another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm#article4 |title=St. Thomas Aquinas, STh I-II, 26, 4, corp. art |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] describes love as a condition of &quot;absolute value,&quot; as opposed to [[relative value (economics)|relative value]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] said that love is &quot;to be delighted by the happiness of another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Love is sometimes referred to as being the &quot;international language&quot;, overriding cultural and linguistic divisions.

==Impersonal love==
A person can be said to love an object, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' &quot;love&quot; of their cause may sometimes be born not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with [[altruism]] and strong spiritual or political convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;&gt;Fromm, Erich; &quot;The Art of Loving&quot;, Harper Perennial (September 5, 2000), Original English Version, ISBN 978-0-06-095828-2&lt;/ref&gt; People can also &quot;love&quot; material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = DiscoveryHealth | first = | title = Paraphilia | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/paraphilia.html | accessdate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpersonal love==
Interpersonal love refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple ''liking'' for another. [[Unrequited love]] refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as [[erotomania]].
[[File:Gothaer Liebespaar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Pair of Lovers''. 1480-1485]]
Throughout history, [[philosophy]] and [[religion]] have done the most speculation on the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of [[psychology]] has written a great deal on the subject. In recent years, the sciences of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[biology]] have added to the understanding of the nature and function of love. 

People with  [[histrionic personality disorder]] and [[narcissism]] may have a limited or minimal capability for experiencing love.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PB2BVBcyb9oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aAc0T5aNH-er0QX8s8WvAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Personality Disorders: Recognition and Clinical Management] retrieved 9 February 2012, Jonathan H.

===Biological basis===
{{Main|Biological basis of love}}
Biological models of sex tend to view love as a [[mammal]]ian drive, much like [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = Thomas | coauthors = Amini, F., &amp; Lannon, R. | title = [[A General Theory of Love]] | publisher = Random House | year = 2000 |isbn=0-375-70922-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], a leading expert in the topic of love, divides the experience of love into three partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety and security.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot;&gt;
http://homepage.mac.com/helenfisher/archives_of_sex_beh.pdf Deﬁning the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction,
and Attachment by Fisher et. al&lt;/ref&gt; Three distinct neural circuitries, including neurotransmitters, and also three behavioral patterns, are associated with these three romantic styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain systems&quot; /&gt;

[[Lust]] is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes [[mating]], and involves the increased release of chemicals such as [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. [[Interpersonal attraction|Attraction]] is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in [[neuroscience]] have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including [[pheromones]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]], which act in a manner similar to [[amphetamine]]s, stimulating the brain's [[pleasure center]] and leading to side effects such as increased [[heart rate]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]] and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-03-093780-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary, a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships. [[Attachment theory|Attachment]] is the [[human bonding|bonding]] that promotes relationships lasting for many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on commitments such as [[marriage]] and [[children]], or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]] to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.&lt;ref name=&quot;human&quot;/&gt; [[Enzo Emanuele]] and coworkers reported the protein molecule known as the [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to previous levels after one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Psychological basis===
{{further2|[[Human bonding]]}}
Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. [[Psychologist]] [[Robert Sternberg]] formulated a [[triangular theory of love]] and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the relationship is permanent. The last and most common form of love is sexual attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment. Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three. &lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (1986). &quot;A triangular theory of love&quot;. Psychological Review 93 (2): 119–135. doi:10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.&lt;/ref&gt;American psychologist [[Zick Rubin]] sought to define ''love'' by [[psychometrics]] in the 1970s. His work states that three factors constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following developments in electrical theories such as [[Coulomb's law]], which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in human life were developed, such as &quot;opposites attract.&quot; Over the last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally found this not to be true when it comes to character and personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves. However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as [[immune system]]s, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berscheid | first = Ellen | authorlink = Ellen S. Berscheid | coauthors = Walster, Elaine, H.| title = Interpersonal Attraction | publisher = Addison-Wesley Publishing Co | year = 1969 | id = CCCN 69-17443 | isbn = 0-201-00560-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various [[human bonding]] theories have been developed, described in terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities.
Some Western authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of [[M. Scott Peck|Scott Peck]], whose work in the field of [[applied psychology]] explored the definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a combination of the &quot;concern for the spiritual growth of another,&quot; and simple narcissism.&lt;ref name=&quot;peck&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Road Less Traveled | isbn=0-671-25067-1 | last=Peck | first=Scott | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=1978 | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination, love is an ''activity'', not simply a feeling.

Psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] maintained in his book &quot;[[The art of loving]]&quot; that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in fact, the &quot;feeling&quot; of love is superficial in comparison to ones commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; In this sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards another, ones self, or many others, over a sustained duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt; Fromm also described Love as a conscious choice that in its early stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only on conscious commitment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromm, Erich 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Evolutionary basis===
[[Evolutionary psychology]] has attempted to provide various reasons for love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a large portion of their lifespans comparative to other mammals. Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental support of children for this extended time period. Another factor may be that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s can cause, among other effects, permanently reduced [[fertility]], injury to the fetus, and increase complications during [[childbirth]]. This would favor monogamous relationships over polygamy.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005. Chapter 14, Commitment, Love, and Mate Retention by Lorne Campbell and Bruce J. Ellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of scientific models===
Biological models of love tend to see it as a mammalian drive, similar to [[hunger]] or [[thirst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. There are probably elements of truth in both views. Certainly love is influenced by [[hormone]]s (such as [[oxytocin]]), [[neurotrophins]] (such as [[Nerve Growth Factor|NGF]]), and [[pheromone]]s, and how people think and behave in love is influenced by their conceptions of love. The conventional view in [[biology]] is that there are two major drives in love: [[sexual attraction]] and [[attachment theory|attachment]]. Attachment between adults is presumed to work on the same principles that lead an infant to become attached to its mother. The traditional psychological view sees love as being a combination of [[companionate love]] and passionate love. Passionate love is intense longing, and is often accompanied by [[physiological arousal]] (shortness of breath, rapid heart rate); companionate love is affection and a feeling of intimacy not accompanied by physiological arousal.

==Cultural views==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

===Ancient Greek===
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes [[Greek words for love|several different senses]] in which the word &quot;love&quot; is used. For example, Ancient Greek has the words ''philia'', ''eros'', ''agape'', ''storge'', and ''xenia''. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the [[Bible]] has examples of the [[verb]] ''agapo'' having the same meaning as ''[[phileo]]''.

''[[Agapē|Agape]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἀγάπη}} ''agápē'') means ''love'' in modern-day Greek. The term ''s'agapo'' means ''I love you'' in Greek. The word ''agapo'' is the verb ''I love''. It generally refers to a &quot;pure,&quot; [[ideal type]] of love, rather than the physical attraction suggested by ''eros''. However, there are some examples of ''agape'' used to mean the same as ''eros''. It has also been translated as &quot;love of the soul.&quot;

''[[Eros (love)|Eros]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἔρως}} ''érōs'') (from the Greek deity [[Eros]]) is passionate love, with sensual desire and longing. The Greek word ''erota'' means ''in love''. [[Plato]] refined his own definition. Although eros is initially felt for a person, with contemplation it becomes an appreciation of the beauty within that person, or even becomes appreciation of beauty itself. Eros helps the soul recall knowledge of beauty and contributes to an understanding of spiritual truth. Lovers and philosophers are all inspired to seek truth by eros. Some translations list it as &quot;love of the body.&quot;

''[[Philia]]'' ({{lang|grc|φιλία}} ''philía''), a dispassionate virtuous love, was a concept addressed and developed by [[Aristotle]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It includes loyalty to friends, family, and community, and requires virtue, equality, and familiarity. Philia is motivated by practical reasons; one or both of the parties benefit from the relationship. It can also mean &quot;love of the mind.&quot;

''[[Storge]]'' ({{lang|grc|στοργή}} ''storgē'') is natural affection, like that felt by parents for offspring.

''[[Xenia (Greek)|Xenia]]'' (ξενία ''xenía''), hospitality, was an extremely important practice in [[Ancient Greece]]. It was an almost ritualized friendship formed between a host and his guest, who could previously have been strangers. The host fed and provided quarters for the guest, who was expected to repay only with gratitude. The importance of this can be seen throughout [[Greek mythology]]—in particular, [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''.

===Ancient Roman (Latin)===
The [[Latin|Latin language]] has several different verbs corresponding to the English word &quot;love.&quot; ''[[wikt:amo#Latin|amō]]'' is the basic verb meaning ''I love'', with the infinitive ''[[wikt:amare#Italian|amare]]'' (“to love”) as it still is in [[Italian language|Italian]] today. The Romans used it both in an affectionate sense as well as in a romantic or sexual sense. From this verb come ''amans''—a lover, amator, &quot;professional lover,&quot; often with the accessory notion of lechery—and ''amica'', &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the English sense, often as well being applied euphemistically to a prostitute. The corresponding noun is ''amor'' (the significance of this term for the Romans is well illustrated in the fact, that the name of the City, [[Rome]]—in Latin: ''Roma''—can be viewed as an [[anagram]] for ''amor'', which was used as the secret name of the City in wide circles in ancient times),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, Reden und Schweigen, Munich, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used in the plural form to indicate love affairs or sexual adventures. This same root also produces ''amicus''—&quot;friend&quot;—and ''amicitia'', &quot;friendship&quot; (often based to mutual advantage, and corresponding sometimes more closely to &quot;indebtedness&quot; or &quot;influence&quot;). Cicero wrote a treatise called ''On Friendship'' (''de Amicitia''), which discusses the notion at some length. Ovid wrote a guide to dating called [[Art of Love|''Ars Amatoria'']] (''The Art of Love''), which addresses, in depth, everything from [[Affair|extramarital affairs]] to overprotective parents.

Latin sometimes uses ''amāre'' where English would simply say ''to like''. This notion, however, is much more generally expressed in Latin by ''placere'' or ''delectāre'', which are used more colloquially, the latter used frequently in the love poetry of [[Catullus]]. ''Diligere'' often has the notion &quot;to be affectionate for,&quot; &quot;to esteem,&quot; and rarely if ever is used for romantic love. This word would be appropriate to describe the friendship of two men. The corresponding noun ''diligentia'', however, has the meaning of &quot;diligence&quot; or &quot;carefulness,&quot; and has little semantic overlap with the verb. ''Observare'' is a synonym for ''diligere''; despite the cognate with English, this verb and its corresponding noun, ''observantia'', often denote &quot;esteem&quot; or &quot;affection.&quot; ''[[Charity (virtue)|Caritas]]'' is used in Latin translations of the Christian Bible to mean &quot;charitable love&quot;; this meaning, however, is not found in Classical pagan [[Latin literature|Roman literature]]. As it arises from a conflation with a Greek word, there is no corresponding verb.

===Chinese and other Sinic cultures===
[[Image:Love-zh.svg|thumb|upright|&quot;Ai,&quot; the traditional [[Chinese character]] for love (愛) consists of a [[heart]] (middle) inside of &quot;accept,&quot; &quot;feel,&quot; or &quot;perceive,&quot; which shows a graceful emotion. It can also be interpreted as a hand offering ones heart to another hand.]]

Two philosophical underpinnings of love exist in the Chinese tradition, one from [[Confucianism]] which emphasized actions and duty while the other came from [[Mohism]] which championed a universal love.  A core concept to Confucianism is ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]]''  (&quot;benevolent love&quot;, 仁), which focuses on duty, action and attitude in a relationship rather than love itself.  In Confucianism, one displays benevolent love by performing actions such as filial piety from children, kindness from parent, loyalty to the king and so forth.

The concept of ''Ai'' (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher [[Mozi]] in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love.  Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of &quot;universal love&quot; (''jiān'ài'', 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally.  Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations.  Later in [[Chinese Buddhism]], the term ''Ai'' (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, ''Ai'' was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.

In contemporary Chinese, ''Ai'' (愛) is often used as the equivalent of the Western concept of love. ''Ai'' is used as both a verb (e.g. ''wo ai ni'' 我愛你, or &quot;I love you&quot;) and a noun (such as ''aiqing'' 愛情, or &quot;romantic love&quot;). However, due to the influence of Confucian ''Ren'', the phrase ‘Wo ai ni’ (I love you) carries with it a very specific sense of responsibility, commitment and loyalty. Instead of frequently saying &quot;I love you&quot; as in some Western societies, the Chinese are more likely to express feelings of affection in a more casual way. Consequently, &quot;I like you&quot; (''Wo xihuan ni'', 我喜欢你) is a more common way of expressing affection in Chinese; it is more playful and less serious.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Miller, &quot;[http://shanghai.urbanatomy.com/index.php/i-ahearts-shanghai/85-i-love-shanghai/429-why-the-chinese-dont-say-qi-love-youq Why the Chinese Don't Say I Love You]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true in Japanese (''suki da'', 好きだ). The Chinese are also more likely to say &quot;I love you&quot; in English or other foreign languages than they would in their mother tongue.

===Persian===
[[Rumi]], [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] and [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] are icons of the passion and love that the [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and language present. The Persian word for love is ''eshgh'' {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}, derived from the Arabic ''ishq'', however is considered by most to be too stalwart a term for interpersonal love and is more commonly substituted for 'doost dashtan' ('liking'){{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. In the Persian culture, everything is encompassed by love and all is for love, starting from loving friends and family, husbands and wives, and eventually reaching the divine love that is the ultimate goal in life {{cn|date=October 2012}}. Over seven centuries ago, Sa'di wrote:

::::''The children of Adam are limbs of one body''
::::''Having been created of one essence.''
::::''When the calamity of time afflicts one limb''
::::''The other limbs cannot remain at rest.''
::::''If you have no sympathy for the troubles of others''
::::''You are not worthy to be called by the name of &quot;man.&quot;''

===Japanese===
[[Image:Ohatu and tokubei.jpg|right|thumb|Ohatsu and Tokubei, characters of ''[[Sonezaki Shinjū]]'']]
In [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''ai'' (愛) is passionate caring love, and a fundamental desire. It can develop towards either selfishness or selflessness and enlightenment. ''[[Amae]]'' (甘え), a Japanese word meaning &quot;indulgent dependence,&quot; is part of the child-rearing [[culture of Japan]]. Japanese mothers are expected to hug and indulge their children, and children are expected to reward their mothers by clinging and serving. Some [[sociologist]]s have suggested that Japanese social interactions in later life are modeled on the mother-child amae.

===Turkish (Shaman and Islamic)===
In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the word &quot;love&quot; comes up with several meanings. A person can love a god, a person, parents, or family. But that person can &quot;love&quot; just one special person, which they call the word &quot;aşk.&quot; ''[[Ishq|Aşk]]'' is a feeling for ''to love,'' or being &quot;in love&quot; (Aşık), as it still is in Turkish today. The Turks used this word just for their loves in a romantic or sexual sense. If a Turk says that he is in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is just for one person, and it indicates a huge infatuation. The word is also common for [[Turkic languages]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] (eşq) and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] (ғашық).

====Christianity====
The Christian understanding is that love comes from God. The love of man and woman—''eros'' in Greek—and the unselfish love of others (''agape''), are often contrasted as &quot;ascending&quot; and &quot;descending&quot; love, respectively, but are ultimately the same thing.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html
|author=Pope Benedict XVI
|title=papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several Greek words for &quot;love&quot; that are regularly referred to in Christian circles.
* ''[[Agape]]'': In the [[New Testament]], ''agapē'' is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love, seen as creating goodness in the world; it is the way [[God]] is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for one another.
* ''[[Phileo]]'': Also used in the New Testament, ''phileo'' is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as &quot;brotherly love.&quot;
* Two other [[#Ancient Greek|words for love in the Greek language]], ''[[Eros (love)|eros]]'' (sexual love) and ''[[storge]]'' (child-to-parent love), were never used in the New Testament.

[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that to ''Love God with all your heart, mind, and strength'' and ''Love your [[neighbourhood|neighbor]] as yourself'' are the two most important things in life (the [[Great Commandment|greatest commandment]] of the Jewish [[Torah]], according to [[Jesus]]; cf. [[Gospel of Mark]] chapter 12, verses 28–34). [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] summarized this when he wrote &quot;''Love God, and do as thou wilt''.&quot;

[[Image:baglione.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Sacred Love Versus Profane Love'' (1602–03) by [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Intended as an attack on his hated enemy the artist [[Caravaggio]], it shows a boy (hinting at Caravaggio's homosexuality) on one side, a devil with Caravaggio's face on the other, and between an angel representing pure, meaning non-erotic, love.]]

[[The Apostle Paul]] glorified love as the most important virtue of all. Describing love in the famous poem in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], he wrote, &quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.&quot; ([[1 Corinthians|1 Cor.]] 13:4–7, [[NIV]])

[[John the Apostle|The Apostle John]] wrote, ''&quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.&quot;'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 3:16–17, NIV) John also wrote, ''&quot;Dear friends, let us love one another for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.&quot;'' ([[1 John]] 4:7–8, NIV)

Saint Augustine says that one must be able to decipher the difference between love and lust. Lust, according to Saint Augustine, is an overindulgence, but to love and be loved is what he has sought for his entire life. He even says, ''“I was in love with love.”'' Finally, he does fall in love and is loved back, by God. Saint Augustine says the only one who can love you truly and fully is God, because love with a human only allows for flaws such as ''“jealousy, suspicion, fear, anger, and contention.”'' According to Saint Augustine, to love God is ''“to attain the peace which is yours.”'' (Saint Augustine's Confessions)

Christian [[Theology|theologians]] see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian [[C.S. Lewis]] wrote a book called ''[[The Four Loves]]''. [[Benedict XVI]] wrote his first [[encyclical]] on &quot;[[Deus caritas est|God is love]]&quot;. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them.&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican1&quot;/&gt;

In Christianity the practical definition of love is best summarised by [[St. Thomas Aquinas]], who defined love as &quot;to will the good of another,&quot; or to desire for another to succeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;/&gt;  This is the explanation of the Christian need to love others, including their enemies.  As Thomas Aquinas explains, Christian love is motivated by the need to see others succeed in life, to be good people.

====Judaism====
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Ahava'' is the most commonly used term for both interpersonal love and love between God and God's creations. [[Chesed]], often translated as [[loving-kindness]], is used to describe many forms of love between human beings.

The commandment to love other people is given in the [[Torah]], which states, &quot;Love your neighbor like yourself&quot; ([[Leviticus]] 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love [[God]] &quot;with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might&quot; ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:5) is taken by the [[Mishnah]] (a central text of the Jewish [[oral law]]) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). [[Rabbinic literature]] differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: &quot;See life with the wife you love&quot; ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:9). The biblical book [[Song of Solomon]] is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between [[God]] and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song.  The 20th-century [[Rabbi]] [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]] is frequently quoted as defining love from the Jewish point of view as &quot;giving without expecting to take&quot; (from his ''Michtav me-Eliyahu'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1).

====Islam====
Love encompasses the Islamic view of life as universal brotherhood that applies to all who hold faith. Amongst the 99 names of God ([[Allah]]), there is the name ''Al-Wadud'', or &quot;the Loving One,&quot; which is found in Surah {{Quran-usc|11|90|q=}} as well as Surah {{Quran-usc|85|14|q=}}. God is also referenced at the beginning of every chapter in the Qur'an as ''Ar-Rahman'' and ''Ar-Rahim'', or the &quot;Most Compassionate&quot; and the &quot;Most Merciful&quot;, indicating that nobody is more loving, compassionate and benevolent than God. The Qur'an refers to God as being &quot;full of loving kindness.&quot;

The Qur'an exhorts Muslim believers to treat all people, those who have not persecuted them, with ''birr'' or &quot;deep kindness&quot; as stated in Surah {{Quran-usc|6|8-9|q=}}. ''Birr'' is also used by the Qur'an in describing the love and kindness that children must show to their parents.

''[[Ishq]]'', or divine love, is the emphasis of [[Sufism]] in the Islamic tradition. Practitioners of Sufism believe that love is a projection of the essence of God to the universe. God desires to recognize beauty, and as if one looks at a mirror to see oneself, God &quot;looks&quot; at himself within the dynamics of nature. Since everything is a reflection of God, the school of Sufism practices to see the beauty inside the apparently ugly. Sufism is often referred to as the religion of love.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} God in Sufism is referred to in three main terms, which are the Lover, Loved, and Beloved, with the last of these terms being often seen in Sufi poetry. A common viewpoint of Sufism is that through love, humankind can get back to its inherent purity and grace. The saints of Sufism are infamous for being &quot;drunk&quot; due to their love of God; hence, the constant reference to wine in Sufi poetry and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article On Love|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/08/ajb/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Love.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern religions===
====Buddhism====
In [[Buddhism]], ''[[Kāma]]'' is sensuous, sexual love. It is an obstacle on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], since it is selfish. ''[[Karuṇā]]'' is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom and is necessary for enlightenment. ''Adveṣa'' and ''[[mettā]]'' are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from ordinary love, which is usually about attachment and sex and which rarely occurs without self-interest. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare.

The [[Bodhisattva]] ideal in Mahayana Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the Bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish, altruistic love for all sentient beings.

====Hinduism====
[[File:Kama Rati.jpg|thumb|upright|Kama (left) with Rati on a temple wall of [[Chennakesava Temple]], [[Belur]]]]
In [[Hinduism]], ''[[kāma]]'' is pleasurable, sexual love, personified by the god [[Kamadeva]]. For many Hindu schools, it is the third end (''[[Kama#Kama_in_Hinduism|Kama]]'') in life. Kamadeva is often pictured holding a bow of [[sugar cane]] and an arrow of flowers; he may ride upon a great parrot. He is usually accompanied by his consort [[Rati]] and his companion Vasanta, lord of the spring season. Stone images of Kamadeva and Rati can be seen on the door of the Chennakeshava temple at Belur, in [[Karnataka]], [[India]]. ''Maara'' is another name for ''kāma''.

In contrast to ''kāma'', ''[[prem]]a''{{spaced ndash}}or ''prem''{{spaced ndash}}refers to elevated love. ''[[Karuṇā|Karuna]]'' is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. ''Bhakti'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term, meaning &quot;loving devotion to the supreme God.&quot; A person who practices ''bhakti'' is called a ''bhakta''. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of ''[[bhakti]]'', which can be found in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] and works by [[Tulsidas]]. The philosophical work ''[[Narada Bhakti Sutra]]s'', written by an unknown author (presumed to be [[Narada]]), distinguishes eleven forms of love.

In certain Vaishnava sects within Hinduism, attaining unaldulterated, unconditional and incessant love for Godhead is considered the foremost goal of life. Gaudiya Vaishnavas who worship Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cause of all causes consider Love for Godhead (Prema) to act in two ways: sambhoga and vipralambha (union and separation) — two opposites .&lt;ref name=&quot;Krishna Prema&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168632408280|author=Gour Govinda Swami|title=Wonderful Characteristic of Krishna Prema, Gour Govinda Swami.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the condition of separation, there is an acute yearning for being with the beloved and in the condition of union there is supreme happiness and nectarean. Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider that Krishna-prema (Love for Godhead) is not fire but that it still burns away one's material desires. They consider that Kṛṣṇa-prema is not a weapon, but it still pierces the heart. It is not water, but it washes away everything — one's pride, religious rules, and one's shyness. Krishna-prema is considered to make one drown in the ocean of transcendental ecstasy and pleasure. The love of Radha, a cowherd girl, for Krishna is often cited as the supreme example of love for Godhead by Gaudiya Vaishnavas. Radha is considered to be the internal potency of Krishna, and is the supreme lover of Godhead. Her example of love is considered to be beyond the understanding of material realm as it surpasses any form of selfish love or lust that is visibile in the material world. The reciprocal love between Radha (the supreme lover) and Krishna (God as the Supremely Loved) is the subject of many poetic compositions in India such as the [[Gita Govinda]] and Hari Bhakti Shuddhodhaya.

In the Bhakti tradition within Hinduism, it is believed that execution of devotional service to God leads to the development of Love for God (taiche bhakti-phale krsne prema upajaya), and as love for God increases in the heart, the more one becomes free from material contamination (krishna-prema asvada haile, bhava nasa paya).  Being perfectly in love with God or Krishna makes one perfectly free from material contamination. and this is the ultimate way of salvation or liberation. In this tradition, salvation or liberation is considered inferior to love, and just an incidental by-product. Being absorbed in Love for God is considered to be the perfection of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Love&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prabhupadanugas.eu/?p=23368 |author=A C Bhaktivedanta Swami|title=Being Perfectly in Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
=== Free love ===
{{Main|Free love}}
The term '''free love''' has been used &lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/h/Hand-bookOfTheOneidaCommunity/ The Handbook] of the [[Oneida Community]] claims to have coined the term around 1850, and laments that its use was appropriated by [[socialist]]s to attack marriage, an institution that they felt protected women and children from abandonment&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a [[social movement]] that rejects [[marriage]], which is seen as a form of social bondage. The Free Love movement’s initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy. &quot;The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism.&quot; Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the free-love tradition is an offshoot of [[anarchism]], and reflects a [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarian]] philosophy that seeks [[freedom (political)|freedom]] from [[State (polity)|state]] regulation and [[Christian Church|church]] interference in [[personal relationship]]s. According to this concept, the [[free union]]s of [[adult]]s are legitimate relations which should be respected by all third parties whether they are emotional or sexual relations. In addition, some free-love writing has argued that both men and women have the right to sexual pleasure. In the [[Victorian era]], this was a radical notion. Later, a new theme developed, linking free love with radical social change, and depicting it as a [[wikt:harbinger|harbinger]] of a new [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]], anti-repressive sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacenews.info/webextras/article.php?id=33 Dan Jakopovich, ''Chains of Marriage'', Peace News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the early 19th century believed that marriage was an important aspect of life to &quot;fulfill earthly human happiness.&quot; Middle-class Americans wanted the home to be a place of stability in an uncertain world. This mentality created a vision on strongly defined gender roles, which led to the advancement of the free love movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spurlock, John C 1988&quot;&gt;Spurlock, John C. Free Love Marriage and Middle-Class Radicalism in America. New York, NY: New York UP, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase ''free love'' is often associated with [[promiscuity]] in the popular imagination, especially in reference to the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] and 1970s, historically the free-love movement has not advocated multiple sexual partners or short-term sexual relationships. Rather, it has argued that love relations that are freely entered into should not be regulated by law.

The term &quot;'''sex radical'''&quot; is also used interchangeably with the term &quot;free lover&quot;, and was the preferred term by advocates because of the negative connotations of &quot;free love&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} By whatever name, advocates had two strong beliefs: opposition to the idea of forceful sexual activity in a relationship and advocacy for a woman to use her body in any way that she pleases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Passet, Joanne E 2003&quot;&gt;Passet, Joanne E. Sex Radicals and the Quest for Women's Equality. Chicago,IL: U of Illinois P, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws of particular concern to free love movements have included those that prevent an unmarried couple from living together, and those that regulate [[adultery]] and [[divorce]], as well as [[age of consent]], [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], [[abortion]], and sometimes [[prostitution]]; although not all free love advocates agree on these issues. The abrogation of individual rights in marriage is also a concern—for example, some jurisdictions do not recognize [[spousal rape]] or treat it less seriously than non-spousal rape. Free-love movements since the 19th century have also defended the right to publicly discuss sexuality and have battled [[obscenity]] laws.

== Philosophical views ==
{{Main|Philosophy of love}}
Philosophy of love is the field of [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]] which attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[love]]. The philosophical investigation of love includes the tasks of distinguishing between the various kinds of personal love; asking if and how love is/can be justified; asking what the [[value (ethics)|value]] of love is; and what impact love has on the [[autonomy]] of both the lover and the beloved.

There are many different theories which attempt to [[explanation|explain]] what love is, and what function it serves. It would be very difficult to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of theories that attempt to account for the existence of love there are: [[psychology|psychological]] theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are [[Evolutionary theory|evolutionary theories]] which hold that love is part of the process of [[natural selection]]; there are [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|spiritual theories]] which may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also theories that consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a [[mysticism|mystical experience]].

{{About|war in general||War (disambiguation)|and|The War (disambiguation)}}
{{War}}'''War''' is an organized, armed, and, often, a prolonged conflict that is carried on between [[State (polity)|states]], [[nation]]s, or other parties typified by extreme [[aggression]], [[Society|social]] disruption, and usually high mortality.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/War |title=American Heritage Dictionary: War |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/war |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary: War |publisher=Merriam-Webster |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of [[political violence]].&lt;ref name=AHD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/war/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as '''warfare'''. An absence of war (and other violence) is usually called [[peace]].

In 2003, Nobel Laureate [[Richard E. Smalley]] identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing the society of mankind for the next fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Smalley Institute Grand Challenges |first=Richard E. |last=Smalley |publisher=[[Rice University]] |year=2008 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |url=http://cnst.rice.edu/content.aspx?id=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1832 [[treatise]] ''[[On War]]'', Prussian military general and theoretician [[Carl von Clausewitz]] defined war as follows: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Clausewitz|first1= Carl von|authorlink1= Carl Von Clausewitz|editor1-first= Michael|editor1-last= Howard|editor1-link=Peter Paret|editor2-first= Peter|editor2-last= Paret |title= On War|trans_title= Vom Krieg |edition= Indexed |year= 1984 |origyear= 1832|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= New Jersey |isbn= 978-0-691-01854-6|page= 75}} Italics in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human culture, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. Some scholars argue that the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by [[John Keegan]] in his ''History of Warfare'', war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John, (1901) ''A History of Warfare'', (Pimlico)&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Societies at Peace (Howell and Willis 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ever changing technologies and potentials of war extend along a historical continuum. At the one end lies the [[endemic warfare]] of the [[Paleolithic]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} with its stones and clubs, and the naturally limited loss of life associated with the use of such weapons. Found at the other end of this continuum is [[nuclear warfare]], along with the recently developed possible outcome of its use, namely the potential risk of the complete [[human extinction|extinction of the human species]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]].]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (c.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre''; the [[Old French|Old North French]] ''werre''; the [[Franks|Frankish]] ''werra''; and the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''werso''. The denotation of ''war'' derives from the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'': “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another posited derivation is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''barbaros'', the [[Old Persian]] ''varhara'', and the Sanskrit ''varvar'' and ''barbara''. In German, the equivalent is ''Krieg''; the equivalent Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and Italian words for &quot;war&quot; is ''guerra'', derived from the Germanic ''werra'' (“fight”, “tumult”).&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Lengua Española'', 21&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; edición (1992) p. 1071&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologic legend has it that the Romanic peoples adopted a foreign, Germanic word for &quot;war&quot;, to avoid using the [[Latin]] ''bellum'', because, when sounded, it tended to merge with the sound of the word ''bello'' (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

==History of warfare==
{{Main|History of war}}
Before the dawn of civilization, war likely consisted of small-scale raiding. One half of the people found in a [[Nubia]]n cemetery dating to as early as 12,000 years ago had died of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;&gt;Keeley: ''War before civilization: The myth of the peaceful savage''&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, Guns, Germs and Steel&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, &quot;One source claims 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W. Henderson|title=Understanding International Law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AwMovLqKw2oC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=9 February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9764-9|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], says that approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|300px|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, Archeologist)]]
Keeley explained several styles of primitive combat such as, small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were perpetrated by primitive societies. The use of the massacre by pre-state societies can be exhibited by the [[Dogrib people|Dogrib]] tribes of the subarctic in North America. The Dogrib tribe eventually destroyed the Yellowknife tribe by killing 4 men, 13 women, and 17 children which accounted for 20 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt; This was a devastating blow from which the Yellowknife tribe never recovered. Keeley further explains how small raids are not organized due to the lack of leadership and any formal training. This causes raids to be short and quick with relatively low numerical casualties but may significantly damage a percentage of a population. The deficit of resources also can account for a lack of fortifications and defensive structures in primitive prestate societies. The protection provided by a defensive could not justify the valuable resources used and labor implemented to build it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keeley&quot;/&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote that &quot;Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty ... 'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [ie, after the coming of the Europeans]'. At [[Crow Creek massacre|Crow Creek]], South Dakota, as noted, archaeologists found a [[mass grave]] of 'more than 500 men, women, and children who had been slaughtered, scalped, and mutilated during an attack on their village a century and a half before Columbus's arrival (ca. AD 1325)' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. D. Rubinstein|title=Genocide: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-50601-5|pages=22–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name=War&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|250px|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's &quot;Peace and Conflict&quot; study indicated that the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J. Wilkenfield and T. nevertheless the concept war is more than just a word but a signification to the meaning Death. Gurr ''[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/pc/ Peace and Conflict 2008]'', Paradigm Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[Mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may hopefully altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it all together. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

Shortly after [[World War II]], as a token of support for this concept, most nations joined the United Nations. During this same post-war period, with the aim of further delegitimizing war as an acceptable and logical extension of foreign policy{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, most national governments also renamed their Ministries or Departments of War as their Ministries or Departments of Defense, for example, the former US Department of War was renamed as the [[US Department of Defense]].

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, &quot;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;EinsteinWWIV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
Fortunately, the anticipated costs of a possible third world war are currently no longer deemed as acceptable by most, thus little motivation currently seems to exist on an international level for such a war.

Still since the close of World War II, limited non-nuclear conflicts continue, and surprisingly enough, some outspoken celebrities and politicians have even advocated for the proclamation of another world war.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewsCommentators&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Ten largest wars (by death toll)==
{{Main|List of wars by death toll}}
Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are of course the two World Wars, then followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or overlapping with that war). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being 60 million plus, surpasses all other war-death-tolls by a factor of two. This may be due to significant recent advances in weapons technologies, as well as recent increases in the overall human population.

==Types of warfare==
{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
War, to become known as one, must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within the broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. [[War Studies]] by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish civil war]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
In general, modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|National defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.

[[Conventional warfare]] is an attempt to reduce an opponent's military capability through open battle. It is a declared war between existing states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or only see limited deployment in support of conventional military goals and maneuvers.

The opposite of conventional warfare, [[unconventional warfare]], is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.

[[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of coercing the capitulation of the other side, as opposed to a supporting tactical or strategic role in a conventional conflict.

Civil war is a war where the forces in conflict belong to the same nation or political entity and are vying for control of or independence from that nation or political entity.

[[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between two populations of drastically different levels of military capability or size. Asymmetric conflicts often result in [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics being used to overcome the sometimes vast gaps in technology and force size.

Intentional air pollution in combat is one of a collection of techniques collectively called [[chemical warfare]]. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in an estimated 91,198 deaths and 1,205,655 injuries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Various treaties have sought to ban its further use. Non-lethal chemical weapons, such as [[tear gas]] and [[pepper spray]], are widely used, sometimes with deadly effect.

===Warfare environment===
The environment in which a war is fought has a significant impact on the type of combat which takes place, and can include within its area different types of terrain. This, in turn, means that soldiers have to be trained to fight in a specific types of environments and terrains that generally reflects troops' mobility limitations or enablers.
These don't include :

===Behaviour and conduct in war===
{{rquote|right|The nature of warfare ''never'' changes, only its superficial manifestations. [[Joshua]] and [[David]], [[Hector]] and [[Achilles]] would recognize the combat that our soldiers and Marines have waged in the alleys of Somalia and Iraq. The uniforms evolve, bronze gives way to titanium, arrows may be replaced by laser-guided bombs, but the heart of the matter is still killing your enemies until any survivors surrender and do your will.|[[Ralph Peters]]&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ralph. ''New Glory: Expanding America's Global Supremacy'', 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The behaviour of troops in warfare varies considerably, both individually and as units or armies. In some circumstances, troops may engage in [[genocide]], [[war rape]] and [[ethnic cleansing]]. Commonly, however, the conduct of troops may be limited to posturing and sham attacks, leading to highly rule-bound and often largely symbolic combat in which casualties are much reduced from that which would be expected if soldiers were genuinely violent towards the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situations of deliberate dampening of hostilities occurred in [[World War I]] by some accounts, e.g., a volley of gunfire being exchanged after a misplaced mortar hit the British line, after which a German soldier shouted an apology to British forces, effectively stopping a hostile exchange of gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert. 1984. ''The Evolution of Cooperation.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of non-aggression, also from [[World War I]], are detailed in &quot;[[Good-Bye to All That]].&quot; These include spontaneous ceasefires to rebuild defences and retrieve casualties, alongside behaviour such as refusing to shoot at enemy during ablutions and the taking of great risks (described as 1 in 20) to retrieve enemy wounded from the battlefield. The most notable spontaneous ceasefire of [[World War I]] was the [[Christmas truce]].

The psychological separation between combatants, and the destructive power of modern weaponry, may act to override this effect and facilitate participation by combatants in the mass slaughter of combatants or civilians, such as in the bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden in World War II]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The unusual circumstances of warfare can incite apparently normal individuals to commit atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waller|first=James|title=Becoming Evil: How Ordinary People Commit Genocide and Mass Killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On soldiers===
Soldiers subject to combat in war often suffer psychological and physical casualties, including depression, [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name=War/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall found that, on average, only 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;/&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times.

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}

Many wars have been accompanied by significant depopulations, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the civilian population). Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, for example, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] states was reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics].

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.

Typically speaking, war becomes very intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons such as the [[American Civil War]]. In some cases war has stimulated a country's economy (World War II is often credited with bringing America out of the [[Great Depression]]) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare serves only to damage the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

====World War II====
One of the starkest illustrations of the effect of war upon economies is the [[Second World War]]. The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials to serve the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html Great Depression and World War II]. ''The Library of Congress''.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial cost of World War II is estimated at about a trillion U.S. dollars worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, E. (2000) [http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html &quot;World War II&quot;] course lecture notes on ''Emayzine.com'' (Victorville, California: Victor Valley College)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P.

By the end of the war, the European economy had collapsed with 70% of the industrial infrastructure destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pilisuk|author2=Jennifer Achord Rountree|title=Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r9kNZrmG0E8C&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99435-8|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated to a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 miles of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors ending a war==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}

{{Original research|section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:Aftermath Battle of Triboltingen.jpg|thumb|Women and priests retrieve the dead bodies of Swabian soldiers just outside the city gates of Constance after the [[battle of Schwaderloh]]. ''([[Luzerner Schilling]])'']]
The political and economic circumstances, in the peace that follows war, usually depend on the [[facts on the ground]]. Where evenly matched adversaries decide that the conflict has resulted in a [[stalemate]], they may cease hostilities to avoid further loss of life and property. They may decide to restore the [[antebellum period|antebellum]] territorial boundaries, redraw boundaries at the line of military control, or negotiate to keep or exchange captured territory. Negotiations between parties involved at the end of a war often result in a [[treaty]], such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, which ended the [[First World War]].

A warring party that [[surrender (military)|surrenders]] or [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulates]] may have little negotiating power, with the victorious side either imposing a settlement or dictating most of the terms of any treaty. A common result is that conquered territory is brought under the dominion of the stronger military power. An [[unconditional surrender]] is made in the face of overwhelming military force as an attempt to prevent further harm to life and property. For example, the [[Empire of Japan]] gave an unconditional surrender to the [[Allies of World War II]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] (see [[Surrender of Japan]]), the preceding massive strategic bombardment of Japan and declaration of war and the immediate invasion of Manchuria by the Soviet Union. A settlement or surrender may also be obtained through [[deception]] or bluffing.

Many other wars, however, have ended in complete destruction of the opposing territory, such as the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BCE)|Battle of Carthage]] of the [[Third Punic War]] between the [[Phoenicia]]n city of [[Carthage]] and Ancient Rome in 149 BC. In 146 BC the Romans burned the city, enslaved its citizens, and razed the buildings.

Some wars or aggressive actions end when the military objective of the victorious side has been achieved. Others do not, especially in cases where the state structures do not exist, or have collapsed prior to the victory of the conqueror. In such cases, disorganised [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] may continue for a considerable period. In cases of complete surrender conquered territories may be brought under the permanent dominion of the victorious side. A raid for the purposes of [[looting]] may be completed with the successful capture of goods. In other cases an aggressor may decide to end hostilities to avoid continued losses and cease hostilities without obtaining the original objective, such as happened in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Some hostilities, such as [[insurgency]] or civil war, may persist for long periods of time with only a low level of military activity. In some cases there is no negotiation of any official treaty, but fighting may trail off and eventually stop after the political demands of the belligerent groups have been reconciled, a political settlement has been negotiated, the combatants are gradually killed or decide the conflict is futile, or the belligerents cease active military engagement but still threaten each other. An example is the [[Chinese Civil War]] which essentially ceased by 1950 but the People's Republic of China fought diplomatically to isolate Taiwan, but it still threatens [[Republic of China]] (commonly known as [[Taiwan]]) with an invasion. For this reason, some historians consider the war not ended but continuing.

==Efforts to stop wars==
[[File:1917 - Execution à Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|Execution at Verdun at the time of the [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] of 1917, when parts of the French Army refused to conduct further offensive operations.]]
Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred ever since the United States declared wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2001, the US government decided to invade Afghanistan to fight against international terrorism that caused the [[September 11 attacks]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in cities in Europe, Asia, and all over the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, work on campaigning against the War. They raise awareness of the war, organize demonstrations, and lobby the governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also exist significant worldwide [[opposition to the Iraq War]]. Critics oppose the war based on the argument of violation of sovereignty, absence of the UN approval, and perceived illegitimacy. 

The [[Mexican Drug War]], with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has been recently facing a fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many have died in Mexico's drug war? |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It has won the recognition of President Calderon, who started the war, but has not ended it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologises to drug war victims |unused_data=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments also use the method of [[disarmament]] to stop and prevent the cost of war.

==Theories for motivation==
There is no scholarly agreement on which are the most common motivations for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Jack S.|year=1989|title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence|journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War|volume=I|page=295|location=New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|editor1-first=Philip E.|editor1-last=Tetlock|editor2-first=Jo L.|editor2-last=Husbands|editor3-first=Robert|editor3-last=Jervis|editor4-first=Paul C.|editor4-last=Stern|editor5-first=Charles|editor5-last=Tilly|accessdate=4 May 2012|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivations may be different for those ordering the war than for those undertaking the war. For example, in the [[Third Punic War]], Rome's leaders may have wished to make war with [[Carthage]] for the purpose of eliminating a resurgent rival, while the individual soldiers may have been motivated by a wish to make money. Since many people are involved, a war may acquire a life of its own from the confluence of many different motivations.

An interpretation of the ancient Jewish commentary (BeReshit Rabbah) on the fight between [[Cain and Abel]] in Genesis 4 (Parashot BeReshit XXII:7) states that there are three universal reasons for wars: A) Economics, B) Power, and C) Religion.&lt;ref name = &quot;MidrashQuote&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Tatars essentially sought booty, especially [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|slaves]].]]
In ''Why Nations Go to War'', by [[John G. Stoessinger]], the author points out that both sides will claim that morality justifies their fight. He also states that the rationale for beginning a war depends on an overly optimistic assessment of the outcome of hostilities (casualties and costs), and on [[Fundamental attribution error|misperceptions of the enemy's intentions]].

As the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare are always changing, theories and doctrines relating to warfare are often reformulated before, during, and after every major war. [[Carl Von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age had its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), On War (Princeton University Press) p.593&lt;/ref&gt; The one constant factor is war’s employment of organized violence and the resultant destruction of property and/ or lives that necessarily follows.

===Psychoanalytic psychology===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, &quot;War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;meerloo&quot;&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p.134, Progressive Press, ISBN 978-1-61577-376-3
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of man's own unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued that human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare. If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed and predetermined by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought that war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought that war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, in history only a tiny fraction of wars have originated from a desire for war from the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. &quot;The Origin of Great Wars.&quot; ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the general populace is more neutral towards war and that wars only occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders that seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

===Evolutionary ===
{{POV-section|date=October 2011}}
{{Disputed-section|date=October 2011}}
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging only in the mesolithic, as a result of the emergence of complex social organization, higher population density and political organization and competition over resources. The other school tends to see human warfare simply as an extension of animal behavior, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

This school argues that since organized warlike behavior patterns are also found in many other primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = &quot;ApesWar&quot;&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; this suggests that between group conflict is a general feature of animal social behavior. Biologists studying primate behavior have added to the debate, documenting warlike activities among several primate species and seeing similarities to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Crofoot, Margaret C. and Richard W. Wrangham, 2010 &quot;Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans: The Case for a Unified Theory&quot; in Kappeler, Thomas M &amp; Joan B Silk (eds) ''Mind the Gap – tracing the origins of human universals''. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that while war may be a natural phenomenon, the development of technology and complex social organization has accelerated the scale of warfare to exceptional levels among modern humans, starting at some point in the mesolithic, and escalating with the development of weaponry and large-scale state formations.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995.

One line of evidence for violent conflict among the ancestors of humans is [[sexual dimorphism]]. In species that have high levels of male competition over females, males tend to be larger and stronger than females. Humans have considerable sexual dimorphism, although lower than our nearest primate relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lewin and Robert Foley. 2004 Principles of human evolution, 2nd ed.p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; The strength difference is greater for upper-body strength than for lower-body strength. Men are in general terms also larger, faster, and more aggressive. Their skeleton, especially in the vulnerable face, is more robust. This suggests that male competition has been an important factor in human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that raiding or warfare between groups of humans in the ancestral environment was often beneficial for the victors. This includes gaining control over scarce resources as well as the women of the defeated or raided group. Various features of modern warfare such as alliances between groups and [[preemptive war]]s were likely part of these conflicts. In order to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (&quot;[[honor]]&quot;). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of warfare and violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, while human aggression may be a universal occurrence, warfare is not, and would appear to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g., the [[Chewong language|Chewong]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Crofoot and Wrangham have instead argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which &quot;coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups&quot;, is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking &quot;tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors&quot;.&lt;ref name=HumanPrimateAggression&gt;&quot;Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals&quot; By Peter M.

War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike.

===Marxist ===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states that all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will only disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxembourg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[economic market|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxist Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian theories and [[youth bulge]] theories.

====Malthusian ====
[[File:US soldiers in Kismayo, 1993.JPEG|thumb|US Army soldiers in [[Somalia]], 1993]]
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=200] |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory is thought by Malthusians to account for the relative decrease in wars during the past fifty years, especially in the [[Developed country|developed world]], where advances in agriculture have made it possible to support a much larger population than was formerly the case, and where [[birth control]] has dramatically slowed the increase in population.

====Youth bulge====
[[File:Median age.png|thumb|300px|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent for South and Southeast Asia and Central America.]]
[[Youth bulge]] theory differs significantly from Malthusian theories. Its adherents see a combination of large male youth cohorts – as graphically represented as a &quot;youth bulge&quot; in a [[population pyramid]] – with a lack of regular, peaceful employment opportunities as a risk pool for violence.

While Malthusian theories focus on a disparity between a growing population and available natural resources, youth bulge theory focuses on a disparity between non-inheriting, 'excess' young males and available social positions within the existing social system of [[division of labour]].

Contributors to the development of [[youth bulge]] theory include French sociologist Gaston Bouthoul,&lt;ref&gt;Bouthoul, Gaston: &quot;L`infanticide différé&quot; (deferred infanticide), Paris 1970&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sociologist [[Jack Goldstone|Jack A.

Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] has modified his [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] theory by using youth bulge theory as its foundation:

{{quote|I don't think Islam is any more violent than any other religions, and I suspect if you added it all up, more people have been slaughtered by Christians over the centuries than by Muslims. But the key factor is the demographic factor. Generally speaking, the people who go out and kill other people are males between the ages of 16 and 30.

During the 1960s, 70s and 80s there were high birth rates in the Muslim world, and this has given rise to a huge youth bulge. But the bulge will fade. Muslim birth rates are going down; in fact, they have dropped dramatically in some countries. Islam did spread by the sword originally, but I don't think there is anything inherently violent in Muslim theology.&lt;ref&gt;‘So, are civilizations at war?’, Interview with Samuel P. Huntington by Michael Steinberger, The Observer, Sunday October 21, 2001 [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/islam/story/0,,577982,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Youth Bulge theories represent a relatively recent development but seem to have become more influential in guiding U.S. foreign policy and military strategy as both Goldstone and Fuller have acted as consultants to the U.S. Government. CIA Inspector General [[John L. Helgerson]] referred to youth bulge theory in his 2002 report &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Change&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): &quot;The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends&quot;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palestinian militant with rifle.png|thumb|Palestinian militant with rifle, 2009]]
According to Heinsohn, who has proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the &quot;fighting age&quot; cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.

A total fertility rate of 2.1 children born by a woman during her lifetime represents a situation of in which the son will replace the father, and the daughter will replace the mother accounting for a small proportion of deaths to factors such as illness and accidents. Thus, a total fertility rate of 2.1 represents replacement level, while anything below represents a [[sub-replacement fertility]] rate leading to [[population decline]].

Total fertility rates above 2.1 will lead to population growth and to a youth bulge. A total fertility rate of 4–8 children per mother implies 2–4 sons per mother. Consequently, one father has to leave not 1, but 2 to 4 social positions (jobs) to give all his sons a perspective for life, which is usually hard to achieve. Since respectable positions cannot be increased at the same speed as food, textbooks and vaccines, many &quot;angry young men&quot; find themselves in a situation that tends to escalate their adolescent anger into violence: they are

# Demographically superfluous,
# Might be out of work or stuck in a menial job, and
# Often have no access to a legal sex life before a career can earn them enough to provide for a family. ''See: [[Hypergamy]], [[Waithood]]''.

The combination of these [[stress (biological)|stress]] factors according to Heinsohn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/DefenceTraining.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:12 |title=Heinsohn, G.(2006): &quot;Demography and War.&quot; |publisher=Webcitation.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually heads for one of six different exits:
[[File:Detenciones Michoacán.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican soldiers detain [[Mexican Drug War|cartel]] suspects in Michoacán, 2007]]
# Emigration (&quot;non-violent [[colonization]]&quot;)
# Violent Crime
# Rebellion or [[putsch]]
# Civil war and/or revolution
# [[Genocide]] (to take over the positions of the slaughtered)
# [[Conquest (military)|Conquest]] (violent colonization, frequently including genocide abroad).

Religions and ideologies are seen as secondary factors that are being used to legitimate violence, but will not lead to violence by themselves if no youth bulge is present. Consequently, youth bulge theorists see both past &quot;Christianist&quot; European colonialism and imperialism and today's &quot;Islamist&quot; civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G.(2005): &quot;Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century.&quot; [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/funnyguy_35/HeinsohnPopulation.PDF&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:25:15]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Gaza Strip]] now being seen as another example of youth-bulge-driven violence, especially if compared to [[Lebanon]] which is geographically close, yet remarkably more peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Among prominent historical events that have been linked to the existence of youth bulges is the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the importance of economic depression hitting the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, Comparative Studies in Society and

While the implications of population growth have been known since the completion of the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.population-security.org/28-APP2.html |title=National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) – April 1974 |publisher=Population-security.org |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither the U.S. nor the WHO have implemented the recommended measures to control population growth to avert the terrorist threat.

===Rationalist===
Rationalist theories of war assume that both sides to a potential war are rational, which is to say that each side wants to get the best possible outcome for itself for the least possible loss of life and property to its own side. Given this assumption, if both countries knew in advance how the war would turn out, it would be better for both of them to just accept the post-war outcome without having to actually pay the costs of fighting the war. This is based on the notion, generally agreed to by almost all scholars of war since [[Carl von Clausewitz]], that wars are reciprocal, that all wars require both a decision to attack and also a decision to resist attack.
Rationalist theory offers three reasons why some countries cannot find a bargain and instead resort to war: issue indivisibility, [[information asymmetry]] with incentive to deceive, and the inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. 1995. &quot;Rationalist Explanations for War.&quot; International Organization 49, 3: 379–414.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
Issue indivisibility occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, only owned entirely by one side or the other. Religious issues, such as control over the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, are more likely to be indivisible than economic issues.

A bigger branch of the theory, advanced by scholars of international relations such as [[Geoffrey Blainey]], is that both sides decide to go to war and one side may have miscalculated.

Some go further and say that there is a problem of information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent. The two countries may not agree on who would win a war between them, or whether victory would be overwhelming or merely eked out, because each side has military secrets about its own capabilities. They will not avoid the bargaining [[failure]] by sharing their secrets, since they cannot trust each other not to lie and exaggerate their strength to extract more concessions. For example, Sweden made efforts to deceive Nazi Germany that it would resist an attack fiercely, partly by playing on the myth of Aryan superiority and by making sure that [[Hermann Göring]] only saw elite troops in action, often dressed up as regular soldiers, when he came to visit.

The American decision to enter the [[Vietnam War]] was made with the full knowledge that the communist forces would resist them, but did not believe that the guerrillas had the capability to long oppose [[United States armed forces|American forces]].

Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Robert. 2002. &quot;Bargaining Theory and International Conflict.&quot; ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 5: 1–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In this scenario, the two countries might be able to come to a bargain that would avert war if they could stick to it, but the benefits of the bargain will make one side more powerful and lead it to demand even more in the future, so that the weaker side has an incentive to make a stand now.

Rationalist explanations of war can be critiqued on a number of grounds. The assumptions of cost-benefit calculations become dubious in the most extreme genocidal cases of World War II, where the only bargain offered in some cases was infinitely bad. Rationalist theories typically assume that the state acts as a unitary individual, doing what is best for the state as a whole; this is problematic when, for example, the country's leader is beholden to a very small number of people, as in a personalistic dictatorship. Rationalist theory also assumes that the actors are rational, able to accurately assess their likelihood of success or failure, but the proponents of the psychological theories above would disagree.

Rationalist theories are usually explicated with [[game theory]], for example, the [[Peace war game|Peace War Game]], not a [[Military simulation|wargame]] as such, rather a simulation of economic decisions underlying war.

===Political science===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2008}}
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security.
Which sometimes is argued to contradict the realist view, that there is much empirical evidence to support the claim that states that are [[Democracy|democracies]] do not go to war with each other, an idea that has come to be known as the [[democratic peace theory]]. Other factors included are difference in moral and religious beliefs, economical and trade disagreements, declaring independence, and others.

Another major theory relating to [[power in international relations]] and ''[[Power politics|machtpolitik]]'' is the [[Power Transition theory]], which distributes the world into a hierarchy and explains major wars as part of a cycle of [[hegemony|hegemons]] being destabilized by a [[great power]] which does not support the hegemons' control.

Military adventurism can sometimes be used by political leaders as a means of boosting their domestic popularity, as has been recorded in US war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent US leaders.&lt;ref name = &quot;MilitaryAdventurism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==War ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|200px|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The seeming contradiction between warfare and morality has led to serious [[morality|moral]] questions, which have been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=Conclusion|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate, generally speaking, has two main viewpoints: [[Pacifists]], who believe that war is inherently immoral and therefore is never justified regardless of circumstances, and those who believe that war is sometimes necessary and can be moral.

There are two different aspects to ethics in war, according to the most prominent and influential thought on justice and war: The [[Just War Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest|first=Mark Edward|title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY|url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/|work=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ|publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-09067-2|page=304|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; First is [[Jus ad bellum]] (literally translated as &quot;right to war&quot;), which dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|work=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a just war has been declared, the second standard, or aspect, is put into effect. [[Jus in bello]], which literally translates to &quot;right in war&quot;, are the ethical rules of conduct when conducting war. The two main principles in ''jus in bello'' are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of Discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moseley&quot;/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just war belligerent, and so thereby forfeit the moral right and justice of their cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304&quot;/&gt;
[[File:RIAN archive 324 In besieged Leningrad.jpg|thumb|210px|In besieged [[Leningrad]]. &quot;Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the '[[General Plan East]]'.&quot;  – ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.''&lt;ref&gt;[[I.C.B. Dear|Ian Dear]], [[M.R.D. Foot|Michael Richard Daniell Foot]] (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.'' Oxford University Press. p.88. ISBN 0-19-860446-7&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Just War standard is as old as Western Civilization itself, and still has significant impact on thinking about the morality of wars and violence today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=Introduction|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|work=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=8/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just War Theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in [[International Law]]'s regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeForrest&quot;/&gt;

These two positions generally cover the broad philosophical and ethical bents mainstream society. However, there are several theories on and about War which are in the minority in culture, but which, because of the influence they have had in recent history, demand mention here. These strains of thought on human society and war can be broken up into two main camps: [[Marxist]] and Fascist, both of which view war as purely practical.

Marxism, and other such [[historicist]] ideals, hold that history advances through a set of [[dialectics]] (as stated by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]]: thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Marx, and his followers, in particular held that history advances through violence. [[Marxism-Leninism]], in fact, held the belief that outright incitement to violence and war was necessary to topple Capitalism and free the [[proletariat]]. In these theories, the question of ethics has no place, as the value of the war is entirely dependent on whether it advances the revolution or synthesis.

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], Racism, and [[Social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-203-87157-X|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism thinks that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so that civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]].

[[File:Fountain of Time full front.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Fountain of Time]]'' honors the first 100 years of peace between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] resulting from the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814.]]
[[File:Peace button large.png|thumb|The [[peace sign]], one of [[peace symbols|several symbols used to represent peace]]]]

'''Peace''' is a state of harmony characterized by the lack of violent conflict and the freedom from fear of violence.   Commonly understood as the absence of hostility, peace also suggests the existence of healthy or newly healed [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] or [[international relations]]hips, prosperity in matters of social or economic welfare, the establishment of equality, and a working political order that serves the true interests of all. In international relations, [[peacetime]] is not only the absence of [[war]] or violent conflict, but also the presence of positive and respectful cultural and economic relationships.

== Etymology ==
From the Latin [[pax]], meaning &quot;freedom from civil disorder,&quot; the English word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew [[shalom]]. Such a translation is, however, imprecise, as [[Shalom]], which is also cognate with the Arabic &quot;[[S-L-M|salaam]]&quot;, has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness. At a personal level, peaceful behaviors are kind, considerate, [[respect]]ful, just, and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors—tending to manifest [[good faith|goodwill]].

This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being &quot;at peace&quot; in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of &quot;[[Silence|quiet]]&quot;, reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] — an absence of disturbance or agitation.

In many languages the word for peace is also used a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[Aloha]], as well as the Arabic word [[S-L-M|salaam]].  In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase 'Rest In Peace' [[Rest In Peace|RIP]].

Buddhists believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends. They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the Buddha adhere to a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.
 
Islam means submission. The title &quot;Muslim&quot;—etymologically directly related to salaam and the name Islam—means a person who submits to Allah in salaam. The submission to Allah (the Arabic proper noun for &quot;The God&quot;, One and Only) is based on humility. An attitude of humility within one's own self cannot be accomplished without total rejection of violence, and a personal attitude and alignment toward peace.

==Religious beliefs and peace {{anchor|Religion}}==
{{redirect|Peace of God|the medieval movement|Peace and Truce of God}}
[[File:Gari-Melchers-Peace-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Gari Melchers]], Mural of Peace, 1896.]]
[[File:Clement XI.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The [[Peace symbol]] in 1701 displayed by [[Pope Clement XI]].]]

Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies.

Many [[Christians]] call their prophet [[Jesus of Nazareth]] the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;, and see him as a [[messiah]] (savior or deliverer), the &quot;[[Christ]]&quot;, who manifested as the [[Son of God]] on Earth to establish [[God's Kingdom]] of Peace, wherein persons, societies, and all of Creation are to be healed of evil.  For persons to enter this Kingdom and experience peace, Christians believe that one must develop a personal relationship with [[Jesus Christ]], who stated: &quot;Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.&quot; ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:28-30|NAB}}) According to Pope [[Benedict XVI]], &quot;Peace is achieved by consciences that are open to the truth and to love&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/angelus/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_ang_20110101_world-day-peace_en.html  Message for World Day of Peace. Jan. 1, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Benedict links peace to ecology: &quot;humanity, if it truly desires peace, must be increasingly conscious of the links between natural ecology, or respect for nature, and human ecology. Experience shows that disregard for the environment always harms human coexistence, and vice versa. It becomes more and more evident that there is an inseparable link between peace with creation and peace among men. Both of these presuppose peace with God. The poem-prayer of Saint Francis, known as &quot;the Canticle of Brother Sun&quot;, is a wonderful and ever timely example of this multifaceted ecology of peace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20061208_xl-world-day-peace_en.html Message for World Day of Peace, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist]]s believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends. They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the [[Buddha]] adhere to a set of teachings called the [[Four Noble Truths]] — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.

[[Islam]] means submission. The title &quot;[[Muslim]]&quot;—etymologically directly related to [[S-L-M|salaam]] and the name [[Islam]]—means a person who submits to [[Allah]] in [[S-L-M|salaam]].  The submission to Allah (the Arabic proper noun for &quot;The God&quot;, One and Only) is based on humility. An attitude of humility within one's own self cannot be accomplished without total rejection of violence, and a personal attitude and alignment toward peace.

===Inner peace===
{{main|Inner peace}}
Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress. Being &quot;at peace&quot; is considered by many to be healthy [[homeostasis]] and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.

Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as prayer, meditation, t'ai chi ch'uan ([[T'ai chi ch'uan|太极拳, tàijíquán]]) or yoga, for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. Finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as the [[New Age]] movement. Inner peace is also the first of four concepts to living life in the [[rave]] culture acronym [[PLUR]].

=== Satyagraha ===
{{Main|Satyagraha}}
'''Satyagraha''' ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}} {{IAST|''satyāgraha''}}) is a philosophy and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] (also known as &quot;Mahatma&quot; Gandhi). He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[India]]n independence and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].

The word [[satyagraha]] itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.

Satyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: “They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...”&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm “The Gospel Of Sarvodaya], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi], Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to [[A. J. Muste]], sums it up: 'There is no way to peace; peace is the way.'

==Justice and injustice==
Since classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).

More recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.

==Movements and activism==

===Peace movement===
{{Main|Peace movement}}

[[File:Peace Tattoo San Diego County Fair 2009.jpg|thumb|Peace Tattoo and Peace Signs, San Diego County Fair, Del Mar, California, 2009]]A '''peace movement''' is a [[social movement]] that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular war (or all wars), or minimizing inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, often linked to the goal of achieving [[world peace]]. Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of [[pacifism]], [[non-violent resistance]], [[diplomacy]], [[boycott]]s, [[moral purchasing]], supporting anti-war political candidates, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and [[lobbying]] to create legislation.

===Pacifism===
{{Main|Pacifism}}

'''Pacifism''' is the categorical opposition to any forms of [[war]] or [[violence]] as a means of settling disputes or gaining advantage. Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved; to calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war; to opposition to any organization of society through governmental force ([[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchist]] or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] pacifism); to rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals; to opposition to violence under any circumstance, including defense of self and others.

Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that violence of any form is an inappropriate response to conflict, and is morally wrong.  Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists in general reject theories of [[Just War]].

===Organizations===

====United Nations====
{{Main|United Nations}}
The United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achieving world peace. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.

{{See also|List of United Nations peacekeeping missions}}
[[Image:United Nations peacekeeping missions 2009.svg|thumb|[[List of UN peacekeeping missions|UN peacekeeping missions]]. Dark blue regions indicate current missions, while light blue regions represent former missions.]]
The UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the &quot;Blue Helmets&quot;, who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.

====Nobel Peace Prize====
{{Main|Nobel Peace Prize}}
The highest honor awarded to peace maker is the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]], awarded since 1901 by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. It is awarded annually to internationally notable persons following the prize's creation in the will of [[Alfred Nobel]]. According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who

{{cquote|...shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | title = Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel | publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Rhodes Scholarships and other fellowships====
In creating the [[Rhodes Scholarships]] for outstanding students from the United States, Germany and much of the British Empire, [[Cecil Rhodes]] wrote in 1901 that 'the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie'.&lt;ref&gt;http://files.rhodes.gethifi.com/Ottawa_September_2011_To_render_war_impossible.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century, and has become prominent again under Warden of the Rhodes House [[Donald Markwell]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/cecil-rhodess-vision-of-peace-highlighted&lt;/ref&gt; This vision greatly influenced Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] in the goal of the Fulbright fellowships to promote international understanding and peace, and has guided many other international fellowship programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/materials/news/Fulbright_18May12_Arndt.pdf , http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/honouring-j-william-fulbright&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gandhi Peace Prize====
{{main|Gandhi Peace Prize}}
The International Gandhi Peace Prize, named after [[Mahatma Gandhi]], is awarded annually by the [[Government of India]]. It is launched as a tribute to the ideals espoused by Gandhi in 1995 on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of his birth. This is an annual award given to individuals and institutions for their contributions towards social, economic and political transformation through non-violence and other Gandhian methods. The award carries Rs. 10 million in cash, convertible in any currency in the world, a plaque and a citation. It is open to all persons regardless of nationality, race, creed or sex.

====Paul Bartlett Ré Peace Prize====
{{Main|Paul Bartlett Ré Peace Prize}}
The [[Paul Bartlett Ré Peace Prize]], named after the artist [[Paul Ré]], is awarded bi-annually by the [[University of New Mexico]] (UNM).

==Theories==
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}
Many different theories of &quot;peace&quot; exist in the world of [[peace studies]], which involves the study of conflict transformation, disarmament, and cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/peaceprogram/ einaudi.cornell.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of &quot;peace&quot; can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.

One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.{{citation}}

===Game theory===
{{Main|Peace war game}}
The Peace War Game is a [[game theory]] approach to peace and conflict studies. An [[iterated game]] originally played in academic groups and by [[computer simulation]] for years to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. The only [[strategy]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was a &quot;[[Genghis Khan]]&quot;, a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led to the development of the &quot;provokable nice guy&quot; [[strategy]], a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. Multiple players continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding the constant aggressor. Such actions led in essence to the development of the [[Hanseatic League]] for trade and mutual defense following centuries of [[Viking]] depredation.&lt;ref&gt;from conversation with [http://sa.ncsu.edu/S&amp;A/faculty/troost/troost_vita.html NCSU Professor of Sociology Kay M. Troost]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic peace theory===
{{Main|Democratic peace theory}}
The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another.

===Theory of 'Active Peace'===
Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the writings of Maine Quaker [http://199.33.141.23/COMMUNITY/FacultyPages/Cox/thewaysofpeace/wopindex.html Gray Cox], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [http://woolman.ning.com John Woolman College] initiative have arrived at a theory of Active Peace.  This theory posits in part that Peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word S-L-M or 'Shalom', called by some [http://www.amazon.com/Shalom-Bibles-Salvation-Justice-Peace/dp/0916035913 the Bible's word for salvation, justice, and peace].  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure.  Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding, Jr., convener of this 'John Woolman College of Active Peace', posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into Active Peace, dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping, and/or peace building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url=http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 07 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Many Peaces===
Following [[Wolfgang Dietrich]],Wolfgang Sützl&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang Sützl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT Münster, Vienna, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of Many Peaces. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.

===Trans-rational Peaces===
In 2008 [[Wolfgang Dietrich]] enlarged his earlier approach of the Many Peaces to the so-called &quot;five families&quot; of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies. A Cultural Approach; Palgrave MacMillan London, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation, the so-called elicitive approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Paul Lederach]]: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peace and conflict studies==
[[Image:Peace-and-Prosperity-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|250px|Detail from ''Peace and Prosperity'' (1896), [[Elihu Vedder]], Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
'''Peace and conflict studies''' is an [[academic field]] which identifies and analyses [[Violence|violent]] and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours, as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent [[social conflict]]s.  This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, 1989: 74&lt;/ref&gt; One variation,
'''Peace studies''' ([[irenology]]), is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, [[de-escalation]], and solution of conflicts. This contrasts with [[war studies]] (polemology), directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts. Disciplines involved may include [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of others.

==Measuring and Ranking Peace==
Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible, various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it. [[Global Peace Index|The Global Peace Index]] produced by [[Institute for Economics and Peace|the Institute for Economics and Peace]] is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the presence/absence of violence. The last edition of the Index ranks 158 countries on their internal and external levels of peace. According to the 2012 Global Peace Index, Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Somalia is the least peaceful one. [[List of countries by Failed States Index|The Failed State Index]] created by the [[Fund for Peace]] focuses on risk for instability or violence in 177 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries. The 2012 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is Somalia, and the least fragile one is Finland. [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the Institute for Economics and Peace, Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations like the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.

[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen - Eva na de zondeval, Rodin.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eve]] covers herself and lowers her head in shame in [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''Eve after the [[Fall of Man|Fall]]''. ]]

'''Shame''' is, variously, an [[affect (psychology)|affect]], [[emotion]], [[cognition]], [[state of being|state, or condition]]. The roots of the word ''shame'' are thought to derive from an older word meaning &quot;to cover&quot;; as such, covering oneself, literally or figuratively, is a natural expression of shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Lewis |first= Helen B. |title=Shame and guilt in neurosis |publisher=International University Press, New York |year= 1971 |isbn= 0-8236-8307-9 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Nineteenth century scientist [[Charles Darwin]], in his book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', described shame affect as consisting of [[blushing]], confusion of mind, downward cast eyes, slack posture, and lowered head, and he noted observations of shame affect in human populations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Darwin | first = Charles | author-link =Charles Darwin | publication-date = 1872 | title =The expression of the emotions in man and animals | publication-place = London | publisher =John Murray | url =http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also noted the sense of warmth or heat (associated with the vasodilation of the face and skin) occurring in intense shame.

A &quot;sense of shame&quot; is the consciousness or awareness of shame as a state or condition. Such shame [[cognition]] may occur as a result of the experience of shame affect or, more generally, in any situation of [[embarrassment]], [[dishonor]], disgrace, inadequacy, [[humiliation]], or [[:wikt:chagrin|chagrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Broucek |first= Francis |title=Shame and the Self |publisher=Guilford Press, New York |year= 1991 |isbn= 0-89862-444-4 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A condition or state of shame may also be assigned externally, by others, regardless of one's own experience or awareness. &quot;To shame&quot; generally means to actively [[Shame#Social_aspects|assign or communicate a state of shame]] to another. Behaviors designed to &quot;uncover&quot; or &quot;expose&quot; others are sometimes used for this purpose, as are utterances like &quot;Shame!&quot; or &quot;Shame on you!&quot;

Finally, to &quot;have shame&quot; means to maintain a sense of restraint against offending others (as with [[modesty]], [[humility]], and [[deference]]) while to &quot;have no shame&quot; is to behave without such restraint (as with [[Pride#Sin, pride, and self-acceptance|excessive pride]] or [[hubris]]).

== Shame vs. guilt and embarrassment ==
[[File:Goya9.jpg|thumb|right|Person hiding face and showing posture of shame (while wearing a [[Sanbenito]] and coroza hat) in [[Goya|Goya's]] sketch &quot;For being born somewhere else&quot;.  The person has been shamed by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].]]

The location of the dividing line between the concepts of shame, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and [[embarrassment]] is not fully standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Are shame, guilt, and embarrassment distinct emotions? | last = Tangney | first = JP | coauthors = Miller Flicker Barlow | year = 1996 | journal = Journal of Personal Social Psychology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.70.6.1256 | volume = 70 | pages = 1256–69 | pmid=8667166 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to cultural anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]], shame is a violation of cultural or social values while guilt feelings arise from violations of one's internal values. Thus, it is possible to feel ashamed of thought or behavior that no one knows about and to feel guilty about actions that gain the approval of others.

Psychoanalyst Helen B. Lewis argued that, &quot;The experience of shame is directly about the self, which is the focus of evaluation. In guilt, the self is not the central object of negative evaluation, but rather the thing done is the focus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Lewis |first= Helen B. |title=Shame and guilt in neurosis |publisher=International University Press, New York |year= 1971 |isbn= 0-8236-8307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Fossum and Mason say in their book ''Facing Shame'' that &quot;While guilt is a painful feeling of regret and responsibility for one's actions, shame is a painful feeling about oneself as a person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Fossum |first= Merle A. |last2=Mason |first2=Marilyn J. |title=Facing Shame: Families in Recovery |publisher= [[W.W. Norton]] |year= 1986 |isbn= 0-393-30581-3 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this line of reasoning, Psychiatrist Judith Lewis Herman concludes that &quot;Shame is an acutely self-conscious state in which the self is 'split,' imagining the self in the eyes of the other; by contrast, in guilt the self is unified.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Shattered Shame States and their Repair |last= Herman |first= Judith Lewis | author-link= Judith_Lewis_Herman |journal= The John Bowlby Memorial Lecture  |year= 2007 |url=http://www.cha.harvard.edu/vov/publications/Shattered%20Shame-JHerman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical psychologist Gershen Kaufman's view of shame is derived from that of [[Affect theory|Affect Theory]], namely that shame is one of a set of instinctual, short-duration physiological reactions to stimulation.&lt;ref name=Kauf92&gt;{{Citation |last= Kaufman |first= Gershen |title=Shame: The Power of Caring |edition=3rd |publisher=Schenkman Books, Rochester, VT |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-87047-052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Nathanson |first= Donald |title=Shame and Pride: Affect, Sex, and the Birth of the Self |publisher=W.W. Norton, NY |year= 1992 |isbn= 0-393-03097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, guilt is considered to be a learned behavior consisting essentially of self-directed [[blame]] or [[contempt]], with shame occurring consequent to such behaviors making up a part of the overall experience of guilt. Here, [[Blame#Self-blame|self-blame]] and [[self-contempt]] mean the application, towards (a part of) one's self, of exactly the same dynamic that blaming of, and contempt for, others represents when it is applied interpersonally. Kaufman saw that mechanisms such as blame or contempt may be used as a defending strategy against the experience of shame and that someone who has a pattern of applying them to himself may well attempt to defend against a shame experience by applying self-blame or self-contempt. This, however, can lead to an internalized, self-reinforcing sequence of shame events for which Kaufman coined the term &quot;shame spiral&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kauf92 /&gt;

One view of difference between shame and embarrassment says that shame does not necessarily involve public humiliation while embarrassment does, that is, one can feel shame for an act known only to oneself but in order to be embarrassed one's actions must be revealed to others. In the field of ethics (moral psychology, in particular), however, there is debate as to whether or not shame is a heteronomous emotion, i.e. whether or not shame does involve recognition on the part of the ashamed that they have been judged negatively by others. [[Immanuel Kant]] and his followers held that shame is heteronomous; [[Bernard Williams]] and others have argued that shame can be autonomous.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Bernard: Shame and Necessity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Phil: chapter four of Shame and Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable. Another view of shame and embarrassment says that the two emotions lie on a continuum and only differ in intensity.

==Subtypes==
* '''Genuine shame''': is associated with genuine dishonor, disgrace, or condemnation.

* '''False shame''': is associated with false condemnation as in the double-bind form of false shaming; &quot;he brought what we did to him upon himself&quot;. Author and TV personality [[John Bradshaw (author)|John Bradshaw]] calls shame the &quot;emotion that lets us know we are finite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Bradshaw |first= John |title= Bradshaw on the Family: A New Way of Creating Solid Self-Esteem |publisher= [[HCI]] |year= 1996 |month= December |isbn= 1-55874-427-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Secret shame''': describes the idea of being ashamed to be ashamed, so causing ashamed people to keep their shame a secret.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, James (1997) ''Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic'' Vintage Books, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Toxic shame''': describes false, pathological shame, and Bradshaw states that toxic shame is induced, inside children, by all forms of child abuse.  [[Incest]] and other forms of [[child sexual abuse]] can cause particularly severe toxic shame. Toxic shame often induces what is known as ''complex'' [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in children who cannot cope with toxic shaming as it occurs and who [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociate]] the shame until it is possible to cope with.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, John (2005) ''Healing the Shame That Binds You‎'' (2nd edition) Health Communications, Deerfield Beach, Florida, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JTuDfNyWR7kC&amp;pg=PA101 page 101], ISBN 0-7573-0323-4&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Vicarious shame''': refers to the experience of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to [[neurosis|neuroticism]] and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper).

== Narcissism ==
It has been suggested that [[narcissism]] in adults is related to defenses against shame&lt;ref name=shame1&gt;Wurmser L, Shame, the veiled companion of narcissism, in The Many Faces of Shame, edited by Nathanson DL. New York, Guilford, 1987, pp. 64–92.&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[narcissistic personality disorder]] is connected to shame as well.&lt;ref name=shame2&gt;Gabbard GO, [http://jppr.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=2819295&amp;link_type=MEDTwo subtypes of narcissistic personality disorder.] Bull Menninger Clin 1989; 53:527–532.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Klosko, Weishaar: Schema Therapy – A Practitioner's Guide, 2003, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] suggested that NPD could be broken down into two subtypes, a [[grandiose]], arrogant, thick-skinned &quot;oblivious&quot; subtype and an easily hurt, oversensitive, ashamed &quot;[[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]&quot; subtype. The oblivious subtype presents for [[Narcissistic supply|admiration]], envy, and appreciation a grandiose self that is the antithesis of a weak internalized self which hides in shame, while the [[hypervigilant]] subtype neutralizes devaluation by seeing others as unjust abusers.&lt;ref name=shame2 /&gt;

== Social aspects ==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}

Shame is considered one aspect of [[socialization]] in all societies. According to the anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]], [[culture]]s may be classified by their emphasis on the use of either shame or guilt to regulate the social activities of individuals. Shared opinions and expected behaviours and potential associated feelings of shame are in any case proven to be effective in guiding behaviour of a group or society.

Shame may be used by those people who commit [[relational aggression]] and may occur in the workplace as a form of overt social control or aggression. Shaming is also a central feature of [[punishment]], [[shunning]], or [[ostracism]].  In addition, shame is often seen in victims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abuse]].

=== Shame campaign ===
A '''shame campaign''' is a tactic in which particular individuals are singled out because of their behavior or suspected crimes, often by marking them publicly, such as [[Hester Prynne]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]''. In the [[Philippines]], [[Alfredo Lim]] popularized such tactics during his term as mayor of [[Manila]]. On July 1, 1997, he began a controversial &quot;spray paint shame campaign” in an effort to stop drug use. He and his team sprayed bright red paint on two hundred squatter houses whose residents had been charged, but not yet convicted, of selling prohibited substances. Officials of other municipalities followed suit. Former Senator Rene A. Saguisag condemned Lim’s policy.&lt;ref&gt;Pulta, Benjamin B. [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2003/06/26/news/spray.campaign.debate.heats.up.html &quot;Spray campaign debate heats up.&quot;] ''Sun.Star Manila.'' June 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this criticism, the shame campaigns continued. In January 2005, Metro Manila Development Authority Chair [[Bayani Fernando]] announced a shame campaign to target jaywalkers by splashing them with wet rags. Sen. [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] disagreed with the shame tactic, and Rep. Vincent Crisologo called this approach &quot;martial law tactics&quot;. Rep. Rozzano Rufino Biazon argued jaywalkers were being treated like cattle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.yehey.com/news3.asp?c=4&amp;i=80091 MMDA’s shame campaign slammed],&quot; ''[[The Manila Times]]'', January 12, 2005.{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=271008 |title='Shame campaign' vs graft backed |date=March 20, 2005 |publisher=[[The Philippine Star]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''school''' is an [[institution]] designed for the teaching of [[student]]s (or &quot;pupils&quot;) under the direction of [[teacher]]s. Most countries have systems of formal [[education]], which is commonly [[compulsory education|compulsory]]. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the ''Regional'' section below), but generally include [[primary school]] for young children and [[secondary school]] for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where [[higher education]] is taught, is commonly called a [[university college]] or [[university]].

In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary and secondary education. [[Kindergarten]] or [[education|pre-school]] provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). [[University]], [[vocational school]], [[college]] or [[seminary]] may be available after secondary school. A school may also be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. [[Alternative school]]s may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.

There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as [[Christian school]]s, [[hawza]]s, [[yeshiva]]s, and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of [[corporate training]], [[Military education and training]] and [[business schools]].

In [[homeschooling]] and [[E-learning|online school]]s, teaching and learning take place outside of a traditional school building.

==Etymology==
The word ''school'' derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σχολή}} '' ({{lang|grc-Latn|scholē}}''), originally meaning &quot;[[leisure]]&quot; and also &quot;that in which leisure is employed&quot;, but later &quot;a group to whom lectures were given, school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=school Online Etymology Dictionary]; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23101960 H.G. Liddell &amp; R. Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/school?q=school School], on Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsxolh%2F σχολή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of schools==
{{Main|History of education}}
[[Image:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|[[Plato]]'s academy, [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]].]]
The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since [[Classical antiquity]]. Formal schools have existed at least since [[ancient Greece]] (see [[Academy]]), [[ancient Rome]] (see [[Education in Ancient Rome]]) [[History of India|ancient India]] (see [[Gurukul]]), and [[History of China|ancient China]] (see [[History of education in China]]). The [[Byzantine Empire]] had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level. According to ''Traditions and Encounters'', the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and &quot;...&amp;nbsp;[[Soldier|military personnel]] usually had at least a primary education&amp;nbsp;...&quot;. The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's collapse in 1453 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry H.|title=Traditions &amp; Encounters a Global Perspective on the Past|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hil|year=2006|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge, and purpose-built structures. At first, [[mosque]]s combined both religious performance and learning activities, but by the 9th century, the [[Madrassa]] was introduced, a proper school that was built independently from the mosque. They were also the first to make the ''Madrassa'' system a public domain under the control of the [[Caliph]]. The [[Nizamiyya]] madrasa is considered by consensus of scholars to be the earliest surviving school, built towards 1066 AD by Emir [[Nizam al-Mulk|Nizam Al-Mulk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Under the [[Ottomans]], the towns of [[Bursa]] and [[Edirne]] became the main centers of learning. The Ottoman system of [[Külliye]], a building complex containing a mosque, a hospital, madrassa, and public kitchen and dining areas, revolutionized the education system, making learning accessible to a wider public through its free meals, [[health care]] and sometimes free accommodation.

The 19th century historian, Scott holds that a remarkable correspondence exists between the procedure established by those institutions and the methods of the present day. They had their collegiate courses, their prizes for proficiency in scholarship, their oratorical and poetical contests, their commencements and their degrees. In the department of medicine, a severe and prolonged examination, conducted by the most eminent physicians of the capital, was exacted of all candidates desirous of practicing their profession, and such as were unable to stand the test were formally pronounced incompetent. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and much of the [[Early Modern]] period, the main purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the [[Latin|Latin language]]. This led to the term [[grammar school]], which in the United States informally refers to a primary school, but in the United Kingdom means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude. Following this, the school curriculum has gradually broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language as well as technical, artistic, scientific and practical subjects.

Many of the earlier public schools in the United States were [[one-room school]]s where a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom. Beginning in the 1920s, one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with transportation increasingly provided by [[kid hack]]s and [[school bus]]es.

The use of the term ''school'' varies by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.

===United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''school'' refers primarily to pre-[[university]] institutions, and these can, for the most part, be divided into [[pre-school]]s or [[nursery school]]s, [[primary school]]s (sometimes further divided into [[infant school]] and [[junior school]]), and [[secondary school]]s. Various types of secondary schools in England and Wales include [[grammar school]]s, [[comprehensive school|comprehensives]], [[secondary modern]]s, and [[Academy (England)|city academies]]. In Scotland, while they may have different names, all Secondary schools are the same, except in that they may be funded by the state, or independently funded (see next paragraph). It is unclear if &quot;Academies&quot;, which are a hybrid between state and independently funded/controlled schools and have been introduced to England in recent years, will ever be introduced to Scotland. School performance in Scotland is monitored by [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]]. [[Ofsted]] reports on performance in England and [[Estyn]] reports on performance in Wales.

In the United Kingdom, most schools are publicly funded and known as [[state schools]] or maintained schools in which tuition is provided free. There are also private schools or [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] that charge fees. Some of the most selective and expensive private schools are known as [[Public school (UK)|public schools]], a usage that can be confusing to speakers of [[North American English]]. In North American usage, a [[public school (government funded)|public school]] is one that is publicly funded or run.

In much of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], including [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]], and [[Tanzania]], the term ''school'' refers primarily to pre-[[university]] institutions.

===India===
[[File:Nepalese school.jpg|thumb|Nepalese teacher and schoolchildren in Pokhara]]
In ancient India, schools were in the form of [[Gurukul]]s. Gurukuls were traditional [[Hindu]] residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. During the Mughal rule, [[Madrasah]]s were introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.

Under the British rule in India, Christian missionaries from England, USA and other countries established missionary and boarding schools throughout the country. Later as these schools gained in popularity, more were started and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in India and the syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in modern India. Today most of the schools follow the missionary school model in terms of tutoring, subject / syllabus, governance etc.with minor changes. Schools in India range from schools with large campuses with thousands of students and hefty fees to schools where children are taught under a tree with a small / no campus and are totally free of cost. There are various boards of schools in India, namely [[Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), Madrasa Boards of various states, Matriculation Boards of various states, State Boards of various boards, Anglo Indian Board, and so on. The typical syllabus today includes Language(s), Mathematics, Science - Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, General Knowledge, Information Technology / Computer Science etc.. Extra curricular activities include physical education / sports and cultural activities like music, choreography, painting, theater / drama etc.

===Europe===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079063-0034, Bonn, Gymnasium, Chemieunterricht.jpg|thumb|Chemistry lesson at a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|German Gymnasium]], Bonn, 1988]]
In much of continental [[Europe]], the term ''school'' usually applies to [[primary education]], with primary schools that last between four and nine years, depending on the country. It also applies to [[secondary education]], with secondary schools often divided between ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]'' and [[vocational school]]s, which again depending on country and type of school educate students for between three and six years. In Germany students graduating from Grundschule are not allowed to directly progress into a vocational school, but are supposed to proceed to one of Germany's general education schools such as [[Gesamtschule]], [[Hauptschule]], [[Realschule]] or [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]. When they leave that school, which usually happens at age 15-19 they are allowed to proceed to a vocational school. The term school is rarely used for [[tertiary education]], except for some ''upper'' or ''high'' schools (German: Hochschule), which describe [[college]]s and universities. 

In [[Eastern Europe]] modern schools (after [[World War II]]), of both primary and secondary educations, often are combined, while secondary education might be split into accomplished or not. The schools are classified as middle schools of general education and for the technical purposes include &quot;degrees&quot; of the education they provide out of three available: the first - primary, the second - unaccomplished secondary, and the third - accomplished secondary. Usually the first two degrees of education (eight years) are always included, while the last one (two years) gives option for the students to pursue [[vocational education|vocational]] or specialized educations.

===North America and the United States===
{{Unbalanced|Education related article|date=November 2011}}
In [[North America]], the term ''school'' can refer to any educational institution at any level, and covers all of the following: [[preschool]] (for [[toddler]]s), [[kindergarten]], [[elementary school]], [[middle school]] (also called intermediate school or junior high school, depending on specific age groups and geographic region), [[senior high school]], [[college]], [[university]], and [[graduate school]].

In the [[United States|US]], school performance through high school is monitored by each state's [[State education agency|Department of Education]]. [[Charter schools]] are publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools. The terms [[grammar school]] and ''grade school'' are sometimes used to refer to a primary school.

==School ownership and operation==
Many schools are owned or funded by [[state (polity)|states]]. [[Private school]]s operate independently from the government. Private schools usually rely on fees from families whose children attend the school for funding; however, sometimes such schools also receive government support (for example, through [[School voucher]]s). Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion; these are known as [[parochial schools]].

==Components of most schools==
[[Image:rathaykentst.jpg|thumb|A school entrance building in [[Australia]]]]
Schools are organized spaces purposed for teaching and learning. The [[classroom]]s, where teachers teach and students learn, are of central importance, but typical schools have many other areas, which may include:

* [[Cafeteria]] (Commons), dining hall or canteen where students eat [[lunch]] and often [[breakfast]] and snacks.
* Athletic field, playground, [[gym]], and/or track place where students participating in [[sports]] or [[physical education]] practice
* [[Auditorium]] or hall where student theatrical and musical productions can be staged and where all-school events such as assemblies are held
* [[Office]] where the administrative work of the school is done
* [[Library]] where students consult and check out books and magazines and often use computers
* Specialized classrooms including [[laboratories]] for science education
* [[Computer labs]] where computer-based work is done and the internet accessed

==School security==
[[Image:Warning signs at CHS.jpg|thumb|To curtail violence, some schools have added [[CCTV]] [[surveillance]] cameras. This is especially common in schools with excessive gang activity or violence.]]
The safety of staff and students is increasingly becoming an issue for school communities, an issue most schools are addressing through improved security. After mass shootings such as the [[Columbine High School massacre]] and the [[Virginia Tech massacre|Virginia Tech incident]], many school administrators in the United States have created plans to protect students and staff in the event of a [[school shooting]]. Some have also taken measures such as installing [[metal detectors#Security screening|metal detectors]] or [[video surveillance]]. Others have even taken measures such as having the children swipe identification cards as they board the school bus. For some schools, these plans have included the use of [[door numbering]] to aid public safety response.

Other security concerns faced by schools include [[bomb threat]]s, [[gang]]s, [[vandalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrensolutions.com/EducationBlog/tabid/532/EntryID/55/Default.aspx |title=School Vandalism Takes Its Toll |publisher=Wrensolutions.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolsecurity.org/trends/bullying.html |title=Bulling, Anti-bullying Legislation, and School Safety |publisher=Schoolsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School health services==
{{Main|School health services}}

School health services are services from medical, teaching and other professionals applied in or out of school to improve the health and well-being of children and in some cases whole families. These services have been developed in different ways around the globe but the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention or amelioration of disease, disability and abuse from which school aged children can suffer.

==Online schools and classes==
{{Main|Virtual school}}
Some schools offer remote access to their classes over the Internet. Online schools also can provide support to traditional schools, as in the case of the [[School Net Namibia]].
Some online classes provide experience in a class so that when you take it you have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect, and even more classes provide High School/College credit allowing you to take the class at your own pace. Many online classes cost money to use but some are offered free.

==Stress==
As a profession, teaching has levels of Work-Related Stress (WRS)&lt;ref name=&quot;WRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrsrecovery.com/ |title=Work-Related Stress in teaching |publisher=Wrsrecovery.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are among the highest of any profession in some countries, such as the United Kingdom. The degree of this problem is becoming increasingly recognized and support systems are being put into place.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersupport.info/ |title=Teacher Support for England &amp; Wales |publisher=Teachersupport.info |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSNs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersupport.info/scotland |title=Teacher Support for Scotland |publisher=Teachersupport.info |date= |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teacher education]] increasingly recognizes the need to train those new to the profession to be aware of and overcome mental health challenges they may face.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Stress sometimes affects students more severely than teachers, up to the point where the students are prescribed stress medication. This stress is claimed to be related to standardized testing, and the pressure on students to score above average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2005/2005_05_06.stress06.shtml |title=Survey confirms student stress, but next step is unclear (May 06, 2005) |publisher=Paloaltoonline.com |date=2005-05-06 |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/school-stress-anxiety-children |title=Children &amp; School Anxiety, Stress Management |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[Cram school]]''.
&lt;!-- Claimed by whom? --&gt;

==Discipline==
{{Main|School discipline}}
Schools and their teachers have always been under pressure — for instance, pressure to cover the curriculum, to perform well in comparison to other schools, and to avoid the stigma of being &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;spoiling&quot; toward students. Forms of discipline, such as control over when students may speak, and normalized behaviour, such as raising a hand to speak, are imposed in the name of greater efficiency. Practitioners of [[critical pedagogy]] maintain that such disciplinary measures have no positive effect on student learning. Indeed, some argue that disciplinary practices detract from learning, saying that they undermine students' individual dignity and sense of [[Self-esteem|self-worth]]&amp;mdash;the latter occupying a more primary role in students' [[hierarchy of needs]].
